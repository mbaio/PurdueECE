Review 0: Burgers, Fries and a milkshake. Life doesn't get any better. The burgers are really good and so are the fries. But what really sticks out are the milkshakes. The Oreo milkshake is my favorite and I cannot get enough. This is the place to go to satisfy that burger, fries and a milkshake craving after a hot summer day of chilling by the pool.


Review 1: Everyone in my family was sad to see this place close down several years ago but we were all excited to see it open again on a recent trip.  Great fries, great garden burgers (most of us are vegetarian) and great milkshakes.  A recent trip to Chandler Mall included lunch at Ruby's followed by a trip later in the shopping spree to consume some milkshakes.  Not a bad way to spend the day (and 5,000 calories!).


Review 2: I love me some diner food and this is a good place to find it.  4 stars for the diner category.  Our first visit here was for brunch.  I tried out the Carnitas Skillet.  It was good, but I discovered carnitas is not great in a scramble.  The potatoes were great.  My wife had Huevos Rancheros and was gracious enough to share with me...good stuff. ...  ... The kids had a burger & mac' n cheese.  Both were good.  The staff here was very friendly and helpful and every request for this or that was met with a "sure!". ...  ... Our waitress was very good and had this almost Amy Winehouse look going on.  I thought she was hitting on my wife as she kept referring to her as "sweetie" or "honey" or "babe" or...but by midway through the meal this had transferred to all of us.
