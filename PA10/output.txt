Review 0: No wait inside but receiving our order seemed to take longer than necessary.  I asked about the Elliot & McClintock location and didn't get any info about that store bit did learn this location is moving East to Elliot & Priest around August/Spetember.


Review 1: They usually have a long wait time in drive through when it's busy. Other than that, the service is good


Review 2: It's been 8 minutes and counting and they STILL haven't taken my order. Joy I'm gonna be late for wk this AM *thanks* McDonalds on 51 & Elliot! ...  ... ------------------------- ... UPDATE ...  ... It took another 8 minutes to get my food that day for a total of 16 minutes to get out of there and YES I was late.  I do have to say that I did go back once since then and this time my order was quicker but they didn't have any customers so I'm not sure that's improvement or not.


Review 3: Not bad. clean, not busy. Food was as good as McDonald's gets. The only bad thing is that the employees were yelling and fighting in the back. Kinda funny but really unprofessional considering the age of them and that the manager was standing there laughing at them.


Review 4: I used to go to this location for breakfast, until the day they gave me a raw egg!   ... The sad thing is that this is the second time this has happened at this location.  I even made sure to tell them to cook the egg all the way through, so you can imagine my shock and utter disgust when I bit into the breakfast sandwich and the yolk began running down my hand!  ... I said I will NEVER go back to that McDonalds because obviously there is an issue with making sure food is thoroughly cooked. ... I did call the manager to inform him of the issue, and he was nice, but nice doesn't change the fact that the staff can't seem to prepare an egg properly.  I don't want to get sick because of someone else's incompetence.


Review 5: This particular McDonalds just sucks. I've only ever gone through the drive-thru because this one is closest to home, and in the maybe half dozen times I've done so, there's always been something wrong with my order, missing, or just cold. Last week I decided to go again before I had to go into work- at this point there was a line of 4 ahead of me. I saw this as a good thing because I figured I'd get some hot fries- wrong! I waited almost 20 mins in line got cold fries, old chicken nuggets and rushed service. This is the last time I hit this Mickey D's up again.


Review 6: We drove to this McDonald location and we were shocked to find it closed. A sign was posted redirecting customer to another location.

Review 0: this McDonald's is one of the busiest ones in the valley.  Service & Cleanliness can be 100% spot on... And then they get hit with a zillion kids and/or movie goers.  In 30 minutes the place looks like it's gone to hell in a hand basket.   So one minute service is just peachy, another and they don't seem to have enough employees.. But there will be lines out of the double laned drive up  window and crowds around the counter...  As a regular there, they do an admirable job but will always have nay sayers at this and similar locations... of any fast food restaurants.


Review 1: They just got a face lift.  The place looks good and 2 drive thurs lanes now.  Still the same good and level of service.


Review 2: Dirty, tables not clean. No mirror in bathroom.  Very surprised. Usually the best place to stop for clean facilities


Review 3: Awful service and such a slow drive thru.  ... Not coming back. ...  ... Ordered a smoothie and they let me order, pay, and wait at the other window until they figured out they don't have any...  ... I sat at the drive thru window several minutes before someone even opened it and acknowledged me and there was a line behind me!  ... They definitely don't move with much purpose.


Review 4: Horrible service for being a fast food chain. Horrible drive thru for late night eating. I'd rather go to the McDonalds on 99th and lower buckeye. Never want to come back here. Ever!

Review 0: I'd say this place is good, they try to do well each day. The only thing is that when I order my ice coffee and nothing else, I end up waiting a little too long to get my coffee. I understand they give orders in chronologically but having to wait only for a drink and no food. I feel that I can get my drink quicker. Get the ones who only have a beverage out and on their way. You will a lot more happier customers that much more. Keep up your smiles, that are welcoming. Thank you

I noticed the service is faster when there is a certain manager around. Come on people.


Review 2: This is the McD's in the Walmart.  Been here a couple of times, but it was mediocre at best.  Was at this "wonderful" shopping location and decided to pick up some fries.  While in there we grabbed a couple of doubles to go as well.  When we got home the food was actually warm including the fries.  This particular experience was not that bad.  The dining area was still messy as it always looks when we walk through the store.  Not a place we frequent often, nor plan to.  However, this time was not all that bad.


Review 3: This is the McDonald's inside the Wal-Mart store.  Nothing special but we still use this one due to the fact the freestanding one across the street is awful.


Review 4: Worst mcdonalds service ever. Walked in and there were already customers standing with complaints about their order. While I waited in line, one if the girls working the drinks, made my hazelnut coffee and set it down. A minute later, the same girl pours my coffee in a smaller cup, tosses out the rest and starts drinking it. When my order was complete, my drink was nowhere to be found. All of this while I'm standing there waiting for my order. The person working my order starts apologizing about how the drink was just right there a second ago so I told her that i know and that the other girl just drank it right in front of me. This got everyone's attention since there are so many people behind that counter just standing around. So the girl who drank my coffee starts making another one as she tells this other girl what I just said. So that girl looks right at me and states "that one". I was very annoyed but at that point I just wanted my coffee. Maybe it's just me but I expect better service even if they are little kids; show some courtesy and atleast act like an adult.

Review 0: Luckily, I beat the rush, because after I ordered, there was a huge line behind me. I was craving chicken nuggets, so I ordered that and some French fries. Chicken nuggets were great, but the fries were unusually salty, limp, and soggy :/. I love the convenience though and the staff was nice and smiling.


Review 1: I went to get lunch around 10:26 and there's always some kind of hassle with these people. The rude woman in drive thru said we're not serving lunch right now. But when I went to the same place 3 weeks ago they started serving it at 10:20 WTF ???? I left this dump. What a lousy way to start the day. Cocksuckers !!!


Review 2: They can NEVER get your order right! The staff is rude, but if you call to complain they leave you on hold forever!! Won't waste another dime in this DUMP!

Review 0: I hate to waste time reviewing mcdonalds but this one does have the best frapps of any I've been to. Also the new Mc D's style inside is nicer than the ugly throw up decor they used to have. That's all...


Review 1: Ya'll know what McDonald's is, yar bugger. If you've absolutely got to have your mayo and fried food fix, this McD's will suffice. It's average. It's not a stay-away-at-all-costs McD's, and it's not the superstar McD's that I'm sure exists somewhere. ...  ... It's new-ish and still in good shape. Nice people. No kiddie play area. Comical dual drive-through, one of whose lanes is blocked off half the time, probably to prevent the drive-through rage that ensues when the person in the next lane cuts you off when it was "your turn".


Review 2: People are nice but this is the slowest mcdonalds ever


Review 3: Went here today about 4:30 pm. Asked for fries with no salt. Never had a problem any where else but, apparently here it's an issue.  I received  plenty of attitude from my cashier when asking for salt packets and ketchup. After being asked to pull up to Mcdonalds waiting lot. I told my gpa, watch she's gonna be a snot and not put the salt packets in.After 5 minutes our fries come out.. With of course intentionally no salt. My reasoning for the no salt my Gpa eat it.. But I can. So he eats his with no salt and I have mine with it. A little FYI for the Mcdonalds drive thu cashier, it's your job honey it's honestly not that complicated.

Review 0: I don't usually both rating a fast food place.  But this was the nicest McDonald's I've seen in the US.  Nicest ever was McCaf in Brisbane where the waiter brings fresh chocolate croissants and espressos on fine china to your table.  So this isn''t the nicest ever but is still heads & shoulders above the others in town. ...  ... This location makes our local Starbucks look dumpy in comparison.  Check my photos.  Modern design throughout with a caf lounging area, touch screen video game corner for the tykes, pub tables, high-backed booths for privacy, blown glass sculptures and a chandelier.   Didn't use the restroom but would hazard a guess it is probably gorgeous as well. ...  ... Double lane drive-through jammed up at evening rush hour makes for a busy bee kitchen.  Folks were hustling hard.  Gotthe kids meals quickly.   And the wraps were a bit better stuffed than some of the other locations that really gyp you if you order them with grilled chicken.  My only regret was forgetting to order a coffee while I was there.


Review 1: Just to be fair. Contrary to othet posts, we take our kids there many times because we live nearby. Both dining in and drive through. Never any problems. The deco is great, upscale looking. Kids love the free archade games.


Review 2: Pretty nice as mcdonalds go. 4 is my standard review on a decent place. This one gets a 3 because of some drive-through mess ups. The biggest one was when I ordered a sausage and egg mcmuffin (and only that!) and instead got a bacon egg and cheese biscuit. Um...not the same thing, folks. Didn't realize until a few miles away when I got the chance to open it. Lame.


Review 3: I ordered the southern fried chicken sandwich from drive-thru, it came without ANY condiments on it.  Just a plain piece of chicken on a bun?  Come on guys, get it right


Review 4: Ordered a egg on a muffin. It had cheese. Ordered a coffee. Sticky caramel all over the cup. Not cool for a drive thru. I had to ask for something to clean my hands so I could drive. Employees have serious attitude. I'll avoid this location which is a bummer because it's convenient. It's just not worth the hassle. Every time we've been here, they've messed up the order.


Review 5: The drive thru screws up my order EVERY time. When I then have to park and go in, no one even apologizes. I avoid this place.

Review 0: Last time I went they put way too much salt on my fries. Felt like my mouth was burning :-/


Review 1: It was an ok restaurant, but the service wasn't that great, they didn't pay attention to the customers and one of their machines is broken... which was supposedly also broken in another review.


Review 2: Service here is SLOW. ... What purpose is two drive thrus if they can't efficiently maintain one?


Review 3: This is literally the worst mcdonald's I have ever gone to. In the last week I went to separate times to get an iced coffee before work in the morning. Only to be told that their machine is down for cleaning. Just a hint....AZ is hot at 6:30am and choosing to clean your coffee machines at 6 in the morning is ridiculous....... most people drink coffee when???? THE MORNING!!!


Review 4: This is the worst McD's we ever been and the slowest. Took them over 15 min to get our food and there weren't even busy. There were couple of other people waiting for their food and seem like they were pissed too because of the slow service and lack of care. There were bunch of young kids working there goofing around. Manager was there but didn't seem to care. AVOID THIS PLACE!!!

Review 0: The burgers are cooked magnificently, and the master chefs have a way with the salads that can't just be beat. I also thank them for posting that sauces cost 10 cents extra - most other McDonalds don't have signage saying sauces cost extra. They often close early on weekends to give staff members extra family time.


Review 1: Always dependable big Mac, fries, and nuggets.


Review 2: Great slides for the three year old; haven't had a service issue, beyond typical fast food worker apathy. ... Oil needs to be chaned in the fryer. :-P


Review 3: This McDonald's is offset from the road a bit. Parking for dine-in or carry-out is quite convenient, but navigating into the drive through lane is a little tricky.  Watch out for people driving out as you try to enter.  Otherwise, it's a regular old McD's.  The staff were resonably friendly when I was there.


Review 4: Don't go through the drive through. They F you in the drive through. Multiple different times throughout 3 years, I have been F'ed consistently. Hamburgers with no meat (hard to validate when driving through). Missing items. Just go in and check your order.


Review 5: IF you go here for lunch don't park in area that is continuation of the drive thru.  ... One person taking orders = a line that rapidly grows and a longer wait for something that shouldn't require a wait. ...  The drive thru is typically the way I come through here and will be the only way from now on...


Review 6: My first time to this McDonalds in....well, I cant remember.  The service wasn't horrid.  It was a bit slow even considering the line through the drive through.  Maybe I was just tired and grumpy.... ...  ... I am a bit annoyed that I asked for dips for my McNuggets and they gave me NONE.  Not the worst out there.  They may get another chance but I am far from wowed at this rate.


Review 7: First time they served me oatmeal in a cup. Second time they have no hot chocolate and I still had to wait in the drive thru. Unsure why the management staff is unable to order the right amount of inventory. Im not giving a 3rd chance to be disappointed.


Review 8: I do everything I can to avoid this place - but the little one likes the chicken nuggets so [we] go when there's a need.  Service continues to deteriorate.  If there is a school night there - forget it.  They can't keep up with whose order is whose, the staff is not prepared for that load.  They never get orders right so I constantly have to appeal to a child who doesn't like mustard on their hamburger.  They are so ghetto - they give old toys in their happy meals - really?!  Like my kid is stupid and doesn't know what it is supposed to be thanks to ads, signage, and what not.  Please do yourself a favor and do not go to this McD.


Review 9: My son has been going there with his friends and though its different times of the day, he has been finding hair in his food. That's fucking disgusting. I hope this place goes out of business. ...  ... My family will never eat there again.


Review 10: Worst customer service ever, esp from 7pm onward. The lady asking us our order in the drive thru didnt know what chicken selects were or if they even served small drinks. I thought it was a joke or something until i got to the window to see one of the dumbest human beings in the world. She didnt ask me for my card, apologize for being rude/ignorant to her own menu, and just flirted with a co worker during the entire transaction. I know its minimum wage at a mcdonalds but Jesus wept this location needs better employees. As a manager of a retail establishment i was appalled at their customer service, and my wife was disgusted with their attitudes. At least the fries were luke warm.

Review 2: Nothing wrong with this restaurant. I mean it's McDonald's... pretty consistent and everyone was great!


Review 3: No one should EVER be able to sit in the drive-thru and write a review on Yelp while waiting for their order! There is no GOOD reason why it's taking this long. My goodness! And don't just throw my food and money at me! And these cold ass fries! Im so glad I dont eat this bs any more! Holy cow!

Review 0: Surprisingly, It was very fast service. Now that's what I am talking about real customer service. Had a Sweet tea, Vanilla Shake, Mcdouble, Hot & Spicy Chicken and a medium fries.


Review 1: This place is pretty good and has a great toddler play area.


Review 2: Awful service.  Did not get my full order going thru drive thru.  Realized it after I got home.  Drove back and went inside to complain.  The guy actually tied handing me the bag of food that he forgot to give me after it had been sitting there for 20 minutes.  Asked for a refund for compensation, but they refused!


Review 3: Horrible service.    Tried to call number and all it does is ring then goes to fax line.    Terrible place to go

Review 0: I like mcdonalds. My favorites are the cheeseburger or quarter pounder.   I usually feel guilty whenever I eat fast food but the one thing I don't feel guilty about is their sundaes.  My favorite is the caramel.  It takes me back to my childhood when my dad would take us for a treat.  I don't know if it's the memories that make it better but it doesn't matter.  I savor the treat and the memories.


Review 1: Fortunately, I didn't have the pleasure of experiencing the inside but I did however get to hang out with the drive thru crew at McD Union 3185. Not so customer friendly voice promoted me to make a selection and I quickly warmed her heart with my awesomeness and she changed her tune to a more friendlier approach. Strolled around the the corner to the 1st window to pay the "man". 2 gift cards (Only reason I was even here) & a couple bucks later I was prepping my next 10' journey to the 2nd window for this ever so delectable healthy American delicacy.  ...  ... Funny story, guy hands me back the empty gift cards & my debit card. I'm in the process of putting them away and he informs me in a very magoo manner that I'll have to go to the next window for my food. So I kindly asked him about napkins & straws. "Next window" So just 1 more for all times sake-ketchup?.... (which I hate and asked at the ordering screen for no ketchup and he says "that's at the next window too". Not really sure if he was catching on with my subtleness but hey, he opened that can of worms....  ...  ... Got that piping hot back of cholesterol and carbonation and I quickly pulled into the parking lot to find out if I won TASTE BUD RUSSIAN ROULETTE & I did!!!! Both me & my little helper got exactly what I ordered. Don't know if its excellent bagger paying attention skills or just dumb luck. Either way I'll take that anyway when you roll the dice at a Mickey D's


Review 2: I havent had a bad experience yet.... takes a long time to get food out tho.. thats the only bad..


Review 3: Love the unsweetened tea here...can't beat large for $1...kids love the sweet tea. Slow service here tho.


Review 4: I went through the drive through today at this location to get some Iced Mochas.  I really wanted Dunkin but with the construction on Alma School I didn't have time so I settled.  First of all, my two large Iced mochas cost me $8!  Starbucks prices, no where near Starbucks quality.  (Dunkin would have been about $3 cheaper--and way better) So I order the Mochas, one non-fat.  I get to the pick-up window, after waiting for the 2 cars in front of me to get their food, and they ask me to park,,,FOR COFFEE!!!!!! So I do.  I live in AZ, it is HOT here. I waited, and waited, and waited...3 cars get their food.  Im hot, so I go inside to grab them.  A nice boy brought me my coffee and appologized (he was sweet).  I look at my mochas and one has carame one chocolate...What the hell?!?..so I go in and say "uh...I ordered Mochas." The worker said "Those are Mochas" in a snotty tone.  So I ask why one has chocolate and one caramel.  She told me the order taker put that in the system.  I told her I said one non-fat.  But I had to go the hubster had to go to work. She says "oh, sorry"  First of all...Why did two coffees take over 5 minutes to make?...Second...how does one get Caramel out of Non-Fat?  I can see getting chocolate and non fat mixxed up (maaaayyyybe)...This McDonalds is super rude..and always messes up orders..if you are going to be rude can you pallleeeaaase get my order right?


Review 5: My husband, Jim W., teases me because I only have one and five star reviews.  I guess that's what it takes to motivate me.  Apparently, I was really motivated this morning at McDonald's. ...  ... No one over the age of eight goes to McDonald's for the food.  We either go because it's quick (sometimes) or cheap (not anymore) or convenient or because we are craving that childhood food memory.  So Jim and I met there this morning  (score one for convenient) for a quick snack and chat about the week. ...  ... While we're waiting for the food I notice a sign that says they have free samples on Monday morning.  I was fascinated by this.  Since when has McDonald's offered samples?  And who hasn't tried their potatoes and needs to know what they taste like?  Who doesn't know the taste of crunchy grease without a reminder?  So, curiosity getting the better of me, I asked for a sample.  I really wanted to see what it was.  That's when I was reminded where, exactly, I was. ...  ... I was told that there was no way I could have a sample.  When I inquired why that was I was informed that the person accompanying me had ordered what they were sampling. ...  ... Oh. ...  ... Though most yelpers know my prolific yelper husband, this woman did not.  In fact, she had no idea who he was in relation to me.  He could have been my husband but he could just as easily been an anal colleague who would rather die than allow me to sample his food, which I assume was the implication in her refusal. ...  ... Now, I acknowledge that this is a ridiculous nothing of an issue.  But these days I run into more and more silly little annoyances and I just couldn't let this one pass.  You see, the woman was very satisfied with herself, as if I was trying to "get over on the man" (i.e. McDonald's) and she thwarted me.  It's just so stupid.  So, I guess they saved themselves a quarter of a hash brown but they got this nifty review instead. ...  ... As to the biscuit I did eat, well ... it was McDonald's.


Review 6: Slow as molasses and got my order wrong. I ordered one iced coffee with sugar-free vanilla. How do you mess that up? I was the only customer in the drive through and it wasn't busy inside. No excuse for the incompetence. After reading the other reviews, they just don't care here apparently.


Review 7: The kids play area is NASTY! I like to come in to let my kids play so I can do my homework, but today the play area is terribly dirty. There is only 1 table that doesn't have garbage on it. I came in at 4 in the afternoon, and no one else was here. I don't understand why the play area is this dirty.  I will not be coming back to this play area, even though it is right next to my house. I will drive to another McDonalds.  Also, I ordered 2 waters and 3 yogurt parfaits, and it took forever. They didn't even have to make anything for me. They were all standing around talking to each other. I do not recommend this place for your kids to enjoy.


Review 8: THEY STILL CANNOT GET MY ORDER RIGHT!!! Why is mcdonalds food like crack?  Hate the service  but cannot stay away!!!


Review 9: This is THE WORST Mcdonalds in the history of Mcdonalds. The fries are ALWAYS cold and old and same goes with chicken nuggets. None of the crew members speak English and if they do they are all very rude and don't know how to say hi or thank you or even have a great day. I actually drive 5 minutes to another Mcdonalds just because this one sucks so bad ( btw- I live next door to this one ). Please, do not come to this Mcdonalds.

Review 0: Great for young children and the staff are always nice. They also have a TV with sporting events being broadcasted in the sitting area by the playground. It's been my only opportunity to keep up with basketball this year.


Review 1: Vanilla Shake and Chicken Nuggets and of course a Mcdouble hamburgers is my JOE's favorite. We come here when we get the opportunity.


Review 2: Been here several times.  They always mess up my order, especially at the drive-thru.  Skip this one and drive 3 minutes north to the McD's at Alma and Queen Creek. It's much better.


Review 3: This is a story about "going the extra mile"... ...  ... Which is exactly what I do when I drive an "extra mile" down the road to a different McDonald's location, instead of going to this, closer, more convenient one. ...  ... EVERY single time I have gone to this location they have messed something up. Wrong orders, forgotten items, miss-charged credit cards, are just a few of the things that this collection of knuckleheads consistently excels at.  ...  ... Save yourself some frustration, and go the extra-mile...down the road.


Review 4: This restaurant in Ocotillo area  appears to be very poorly managed.  Just moved in to this area and have given this location several visits. ... The employees can't smile, takes them forever to greet at the speaker,I received the wrong salad - called them from home - mgr said come back mention my name and we will replace the salad for you.  i went back the following evening and they flat out refused  to do anything- sorry we don't if this happened or not- the mgr is off today. Unbelievable!!!very poor training and employees don't care-most likely the mgr doesn't care either.

Review 0: I come here occasionally as it is close to work and cheap eats.  I can't say I've really had some of the issues others have.  Food's been generally fine and seemed fresh within reason for fast food, the staff usually is cool and the wait time varies from eh to good. ...  ... The only thing that bugs me is you have to remember to ask for ketchup because they rarely if ever ask and I've yet to have them just give it to me.  I *LIKE* ketchup with my fries, dang it!


Review 1: Run of the mill McDonald's which is one convenient exit & about two blocks off the freeway.  Appears to be a newer building with two ordering lanes.  There's a HUGE cactus for you to stare at while waiting for your order to come up.


Review 2: Two key points: ...  ... 1) It's new, so, it's still mostly clean and the grease traps haven't reached critical mass yet. ...  ... 2) If you're headed toward Tucson on I-10 east, this is really the last convenient place to get off before you get to Casa Grande exit 195 which is like a billion miles away. So if you're hungry GET OFF NOW. ...  ... That is all.


Review 3: horrible old buns,.food cold first.mcdonalds that really messed up a simple burger###yeah fellow yelpers stay away from this one!


Review 4: I had no choice, but to choose a star. Over the years this Mc Donalds continues to disappoint.  I truly believe this franchise owner really does not care. This morning will be last time I go there. The people at my job have had similar dissapointing experiences with the same place. It is close and convenient for us. But they would rather go to another location nearby or somewhere close to their home, when commuting to work. This morning I ordered strawberry cream pie and was told again that they had none and asked if can be I would like apple pies instead. About fifteen minutes later at work. The apple pie was hard as a rock. More like a apple biscuit. This is the final straw. This place is horrible. The list of things that I have ordered over time is too long to list. Mc Donald Corp should pull their licensing away from owner. I have took time from my day to write this, rather than spending it on something else more productive.


Review 5: This McDonald's can kiss it. And there servers. I only been here 3 times since its right around the corner form my work. I'd rather drive 10 miles to a good service and better food place then this. The service always sucks. The Piss inside lack communication and brains. As well as emotions. I think a robot could do better. And the food is always stale. Like its been under a heat lamp all day. Nasty fools.

Review 0: Service and tried and true menu is always just good. Crazy corner location is sometimes dufficult to navigate.


Review 1: As with most fast food joints, this McDonalds is hit or miss.  I'd say about half the time I get out with exactly what I ordered and no strange encounters.   ...  ... The most common problem I've had here is getting sauce for my nuggets.  They usually ask when I'm ordering, but I've learned to double check when I get my bag anyway.  Once, they distracted me from checking for sauce by failing to give me a straw.  I got my straw, forgot the sauce.   ...  ... On one visit, the girl at the second window made it through our entire exchange without actually speaking to me or looking at me. ...  ... The food is consistently typical McDonalds food, which isn't good, but it's what I go to get.  The line tends to move quick with the double ordering lines.  The location couldn't be more convenient to my house, which is probably not a good thing.  Overall, it is exactly what I expect and I know the subsequent stomach ache is my own fault.


Review 2: Expect to wait for a really long time in the drive-thru, especially at night.


Review 3: So I dropped in for a quick lunch and a soda the other day with a friend of mine.  We just wanted something small.  So I ordered two chicken sandwiches and two cokes.  The girl said something that was not understandable and I said, " What?  Say again?"  -- she said something garbled again.  I really hate those establishments that hire people who cannot speak English.  I finally figured out she was saying "do you want fries with that?".  So I said fries with only one of them.  So she rang me up and pointed to the cash register readout that said $8.68.  So I paid. ...  ... When they called my number, I got one sandwich, one small fries, and two small drinks.  I said that I ordered two sandwiches which the girl could not understand again.  So she had to call the Manager over and he told me that my order was for only one sandwich.  So I said, "$8.68 for one small sandwich (not even a premium sandwich), small fries, and small coke?".  So to get the other sandwich they charged me $4.90.  WTF??? Almost $14 for our snack/lunch?  Not only another example where you are better off going for a real lunch at places where you can get a lunch special for $5.99 or $6.99, and get good table service, and they have employees who can speak and comprehend the English language.  And even for fast food restaurants, JIB is better, cheaper, and higher in quality. ...  ... I normally do not frequent MacDonalds because I always thought they sucked.  But this place was convenient to my cause the other day, but I will now never go back again.


Review 4: The only reason they have my business is because I'm along for the ride already. Can't say they haven't messed up my order in some sort of way.  ... Those things including simple tasks like reading the order back, checking for all the items & even correct greetings. I know you can, I would like you to and make your money.


Review 5: Wow. Unbelievably disgusting customer service. I don't expect much except general courtesy and professionalism from any fast food place- and we received LESS than that today from Elizabeth Hernandez. She was disrespectful and absolutely unprofessional when I declined to donate a dollar to their fundraiser for kids. She said 'um okay well, it helps kids' while giving me a sideways look! I said I don't need you to belittle me because I don't donate to this cause, I help children every single day. And she replied, 'ya okay' and rolled her eyes at me! I cannot believe that. I will be taking it a step further and contacting corporate regarding her lack of customer service skills.... I'm pretty sure they don't want people representing them that way.

Review 0: Ever see that film by Morgan Spurlock about McDonald's called "Super-Size Me?" I didn't eat at McDonald's for at least two years after being grossed out by that movie! That being said, my Wife and I were super tired, heading out for a camping weekend at night, and we needed something to eat. Along Shea Blvd there in Fountain Hills, there's Wendy's, which I have given up on (expensive, small, and crappy); Taco Bell (NEVER); Arby's (weird, fake roast beef); Subway (genera-sandwich); & a few others. Long and the short of it is this... This food was just plain lousy, tasteless, grotesque, cold, and supremely awful! Had some chicken-part nuggets dipped in sugar sauces of your choice, an "Angus" burger, and the fries were cold, gritty, and tasteless. I really can't understand how and why people eat "food" at these places? Besides the totally disgusting food, the bill was like 18 bucks for the two of us, there were flies all over, and people were smoking just outside the entrance. I was grossed out for the rest of the evening- So much so, we postponed the camping trip and left the next morning because we were both a little upset to our stomachs. Think I'm exaggerating? Go eat there yourself.


Review 1: Gross food horrible parking.


Review 2: I seldom eat at McDonalds but my grandson prefers them and I like to cater to his likes when he viisits. Last evening was our third trip there and if I can help it it will be the last, It gets dirtier every time we go, the service staff are very unfriendly and many need training, they frequently are out of something or the machine is down, and they often get the order wrong. While this McDonalds is about 5 minutes from my home, I will spend another 15 minutes each way to go to another one in Scottsdale.


Review 3: It was 11:30am and my wife was out with the girls for lunch and I was craving a nice greasy McDonald's hamburger and fries. This McDonalds was on my way home from a meeting and was the perfect place to fulfill my gastric cravings. ... At the drive through I ordered a quarter pounder with cheese meal. I live about 5 minutes from the McDonalds and my mouth was watering all the way home. Got home and unpacked my goody bag. I took one bite of the hamburger expecting my cravings to be answered. Well...the bun was HARD, the burger DRY and the fries were like dry straw! At least the diet coke was as advertised!  ... I landed up throwing it all in the trash and eating a leftover salad from the fridge.  ... The quality control at that McDonald's is horrible and I will never go back there again and would tell others to do the same for take out. Eat in, you can always go back to the counter and get a freshly made replacement.


Review 4: It's a bathroom stop.  Food is bad, place is always dirty, people are okay, iced tea is good.  Playground's always dirty, I would never let my kid play there.  Yuck.

Review 0: For a "toxic" meal this location is pretty clean.


Review 1: I peed here many times. And I've eaten here - well not here - I ordered at the drive through and ate in my car on the way to/from Cali but same thing, right? ...  ... Anyway, its a clean anf fast McDonalds. What else can you ask for? Good job.


Review 2: Most of you know what to expect at a McDonalds, so I will keep this one very short:  fast service, hot food, and fairly clean.  It makes for a decent pit-stop in Gila Bend.


Review 3: Considering this Mickey D's is one of very few choices to stop for food and restrooms on the way to/from Rocky Point, we ended up stopping here twice over the long weekend. ...  ... I'm not a fast food fan, and I'm especially not a huge fan of McDonald's but I do have to say that they make a mean ice cream cone!  I had a coffee on our first stop, which was just fine (although they didn't have my preferred sweetener - the pink one).  On the way back, I went with a classic crispy chicken sandwich and had a few of Jared's fries; both were pretty gross.  For 55 cents though, I had a bag of apple slices, which was a not only a great deal but a healthy option too.   ...  ... Decent bathrooms and a changing station to boot, I was thankful for that (as was baby M).  This is definitely not a destination but a decent road trip stop.  Be prepared though, it gets very busy on holiday weekends!


Review 4: good fast service, and the food didn't disappointed. i must have come in at the end of a rush because it was a little nasty in there.


Review 5: Great McDonald's.  We stop here every time we drive from San Diego to Phoenix.  Always clean and consistently good.  Nice and new too.  Only 3 stars, though, because it is after all a McDonald's.


Review 6: Absolutely the worst McDonald's anywhere!   Bathroom's trash was overflowing and had no toilet paper.  Most pathetic looking employees ever - everyone looked miserable.   Manager was a total beeoch  when I told her she was giving us the wrong food and stormed off.  Rather than emptying the trash bins a worker used some metal device to smash it down.  Gross!  Food took at least 5 minutes to come out and was mediocre.   Go somewhere else!!


Review 7: Stopped here to pee and eat breakfast our way to Rocky Point from Phoenix. Being a popular stopping point for those going to Mexico and San Diego you would think they would be suited to handle a plentiful amount of customers.....Nope. Walked in to see the counter lined with at least twenty tickets that hadn't been made and the kitchen staff seemed to move at a glacial pace. We were able to order right away but got stuck waiting 10 minutes before they called our number only to tell us they were out of sausage. Did I mention it was only 7:30? They still had three hours to go! After yet another 10 minutes they finally were substituted two sad looking bacon strips on a biscuit and called my number. It was the driest thing I have ever eaten. Not that I'm expecting much from McDonalds but c'mon!


Review 8: The first Drive up window is covered with a sunblock screen, I drove by it only to hear knocking from the back of my truck. So I pulled back to pay. Then they forgot straws. Then had to pull back because they gave my 2 year old frys instead of apples. Gila bend is punishment from above!

Review 0: I really like this McDonald's location. All of the workers, whether it be early morning, late night are really nice. Heck, I'll admit it, I've been through this drive thru a few too many times and most of the workers recognize my face and we'll get chatting (if there are no cars behind me).  ...  ... Why review a McDonald's you ask? Plain and simple, the workers here are phenomenal and shoot, I know I'm a pain when I ask for a 'fresh batch of fries' each time I visit. The fact that they  take the effort to throw some fresh tatters in the frier for me is extra nice!


Review 1: Not much to say about this place. It is a McDonalds. Though its cleaner than others, and they are usually pretty friendly. I have gone through the drive through and it is always slammed. So just parking and going in might save you a little time. ...  ... If your looking for something for the kids (playhouse), its small and just like a little playhouse.  So go to the one on Guadalupe and Val Vista.


Review 2: It's McDonalds.  Sometimes I get cravings for McDonald's (I know it's not the best food to eat), but it sure hits the spot! ...  ... I always go through the drive-through and it's not too bad because there are two places to drive through that take orders that funnel into one place to pay and pick up food. ...  ... Three stars because it's not particularly delicious, gourmet food.  But this place does a great job at being McDonald's!

Review 0: Who knew you could get kicked out of this MCD by an non-employee! Better watch your step here or the guy who sits by the counter will get you! Hehe. Just better buy something! Can't even use my wifi here in peace! I like the Mcd on Val Vista and Guadalupe better at least the manager there is courteous and polite to everyone. ... no privacy here either. Really, the management needs to let the employees do the table cleaning!They get off easy and hardly do anything! wow, what a shame! ...  ... Well, thats all I have to say! Oh wait one more thing, I won't be coming back here again so thet dude can irritate the snot out of me! Oh my goodness, how annoying! ...  ... I hope the management and owners read this!


Review 1: Came home from a family vacation thinking we'll grab some McDonald's for the kids since it was late and had work and preschool the next morning. Turned down Wendy's, In N Out, and Burger King for the kids. Big Mistake. ...  ... Service was bad and the food was cold.  ...  ... My advice: find another McDonald's if you must have it or go some place else before you go to this place. Plain terrible. Gave me the wrong burger and it was cold. The fries were also cold. They must be trying to see if they can be the worst fast food restaurant in the area. They are number 1 in terrible.


Review 2: I'm really irritated because when I ordered my lunch today the girl that took my order  clearly wasn't listening to me and charged me way less than what I owed. The soda I ordered was flat and syrupy and the manager was very rude to me. ...  ... From now I'll be going to to my favorite McD's on Val Vista and Guadalupe. At least I have never been told that I can't have refills because the manager thinks I'm sitting outside! ...  ... Maybe if they decide to stop being so rude! ...  ... I don't appreciate the rudeness!


Review 3: THIS PLACE IS A JOKE!!! Now, I will start by saying that this is McD, so you get what you pay for and shouldn't expect more. HOWEVER, with that being said, I think that this is worst fast food cst service I have ever! This McD is right across the street from our house, and since we were is a hurry, we decided to drive thru. I am actually not  a McD fan, I do like their chicken nuggets, and frequently drive thru for a large Dr. Pepper. Tonight, my husband and I drove thru and ONLY ORDERED: 20 CHICKEN NUGGETS, 2 LARGE DR. PEPPER, & a MEDIUM FRY. That is not a large order, not complicated, or any reason to receive the 'service' we did. We were told to move forward because they were waiting on our chicken nuggets. OK, no problem. PROBLEM: SIX CARS GOT THEIR FOOD AT THE WINDOW BEFORE I SENT MY HUSBAND IN TO GET OUR FOOD! He got it and we drove away, just to find out that we were MISSING OUR FRYS!!! Are you SERIOUS!??!!!! We went back and went in to get it corrected and give the manager a piece of my mind!!! Besides some shallow "i'm sorry's", they gave us our nuggets, and some 'fresh frys' which were no where close to being fresh! I really CAN NOT believe the 'service' we received there, and vow to go out of our way to go to another McD from now on, or pay a bit more & go to our FAVORITE chicken spot, CHICK FIL A!!! Friendly, nice, accurate, and even though it is still a fast food place, they SERVE YOU, come to you table to clear it, and refill your drinks, all with a happy attitude! Oh, and did I mention the FRESH FLOWERS ON EVERY TABLE?!!! Yep, now THAT is cst service that goes above and beyond the call of duty!!! ;) My advice to them: RETRAIN, TEACH CST SERVICE, ESPECIALLY TO THEIR MANAGERS!!!!


Review 4: You get the food the way they want to give it to you not the way you  want to receive the food. I asked to speak to the manager , and she barely spoke any English at all. All she kept saying was sorry we do better next time sorry we do better next time

Review 0: I work really close to this McDonald's so I stop in often before work for a drink or snack and it's probably the most consistent place I've been to in regards to service. I've always been in and out of the drive thru in less than a couple if minutes and my order has never been wrong even when I'm picky about how much ice is in my drink. Love this McDonald's!


Review 1: They are always friendly at this McDonald's.  My husband loves the Chocolate Chip Frappe and one time they made this incorrectly, but we were already several miles away.  I called them back and said the Frappe didn't taste correct.  We went back and they made another one for us free of charge and we got to keep the one that didn't taste quite as sweet. ...  ... This McDonald's is very inviting, clean, with a large children's play area, TV sets.  Sometimes service inside is a bit slow, but if we go inside, we are not in a hurry.  They usually get our order correct at the drive-thru. ...  ... I just wished they had the Hot n'Spicy McChicken still on the dollar menu, as my husband likes that.


Review 2: This is the cleanest McDonald's I have ever been to. Plus they have a huge toddler play area with flat screen tv. It was so nice to sit here and enjoy my coffee and newspaper while the kids played. The play area is just like the mall, but without the filth and crowds. There is a hand sanitizing station and a sign that says to use before and after play. The play structures aren't those disgusting tube slides and ball pits that are impossible to clean. These can actually be cleaned! (See pics). I hope this stays my little secret. Free wi-Fi too! Friendly employees. Food is of the same quality you'd find at your typical McDonald's. I just thought the decor, atmosphere, cleaniness and play area were good enough to Yelp about.


Review 3: Saturday 0730 and I'm waiting in the drive thru for more than 15minutes. Only one person taking orders on two lanes.  Received my order exactly as ordered and gentleman that delivered my order was friendly.


Review 4: What is the deal with the double drive-thru?  This McDonald's is always busy, so I guess the two lanes help break up traffic for like a second, but here's what ends up happening..  There are two lanes to place orders, but then they merge to one lane for the pay window and pick up window.  So you choose a lane, place your order, and then as you inch up toward the pay window, the guy in the other order lane speeds up to try to get in front of you to get his food first... well guess what, buddy, I ordered first, so my food is going to be ready first!  It's so annoying!


Review 5: When u gotta clog the arteries I'm sure you know where to go. Service here is fast and the employees are always smiling


Review 6: Horrible service here, Sat in the 2nd drive through while 5 cars placed their order in drive through number one. Someone behind me got our and walked the window to complain.  Got my child's happy meal with no chicken nuggets, just fries and Apple's.  Forgot to give me straws and had to remind them 2 times for the milk.  When I went back to complain and just return my food and get my refund one manager pushed me of to another and then he argued with me that I did have the chicken. Don't like McDonald's anyway and hardly ever go there, this just sealed the deal for me.  Good luck with the rebranding of Ronald, with service like this it won't matter.


Review 7: worst service ever!!!! :(

Review 0: I enjoyed a McDonald's breakfast here & the food tasted good considering its fast food. The food wasn't greasy and I actually enjoyed it. Always love the mocha frapp


Review 1: I never thought I'd see the day where I was reviewing a fast food chain.  But this place has a great breakfast with great service. ...  ... I just recently found out that the Egg McMuffin can be ordered as an Egg WHITE McMuffin.  And the hot cakes...for fast food quality, 4 stars! ...  ... And you can't beat the price.  I ordered and Egg white McMuffin, 3 hash browns, 1 biscuit, and 1 coffee for 11 bucks! ... Enjoy


Review 2: This is close to my house and is open 24 hours a day so I come here allot. Its McDonalds what can I say fries and burgers. Lately I like coming here for breakfast and get pancakes with  iced coffee which I enjoy. They have dollar parfait's that are good. This location has two drive threw that get backed up sometimes. I'm sure most of you have had McDonalds and this location has all the same meals and burgers. The food is always good and seems to be fresh here and the workers are friendly also.


Review 3: I really hate this place!! Came here and ate b fast today. Wanted to use my laptop here to do some work on the internet and i needed to plug in, they have free wifi here but no WORKING OUTLETS!!!! How ridiculous is that!  Dont come here to use your laptop or the free wifi!  The workers here dont take concerns seriously they didnt even care that i couldnt find an outlet even when i said i would never come back!!! ...  ... what an embarassment!!!

Review 0: Always so fast, consistent and courteous. Nice to see the same people working there for many years.


Review 1: This MC is on my way to work. In the mornings I usually go and get some coffee to wake me up. I ordered one of their mcafe things and an apple pie. The coffee was great and with some creamer it tasted damn good.  ...  ... The apple pie was awesome and reminded me of how much I loved  the warm apple pies my mom was preparing me when I was a little kid. Even though it was really hot when I got it, that first bite tasted like heaven.  ...  ... Mixed with the coffee and considering how inexpensive the meal was itself I must say my breakfast was so good.  ...  ... I know it is not the healthiest of choices but sometimes I like to throw health out the window when it comes to being happy and eating things that just taste really really good. I'll probably get breakfast there more often now especially since I don't really like eating breakfast at home.


Review 2: All I ordered was 2 large fries, it took 11 minutes. Here with 3 kids, there are no napkins in the dispensers. Trash everywhere. I only see young kids/teenagers working, they seem lost and confused. Tried ordering sundaes also and they had no spoons! I wish there were a Chik-Fil-A closer!!


Review 3: Bad attitude  never thought I would not go to a McDonald's  this one never go back. Always trying to up sell  please its fast food


Review 4: Got my order to go, when I arrived home, noticed one of the sandwiches was missing.  No big deal, mistakes are made, the rating is for the response I received when I called.  Acted like the didn't believe me.  No, come on back, we"ll have it waiting, no apology, nothing.


Review 5: If I could give a 0 for this McDonald's I would.  This seriously is the WORST, I mean very WORST fast food place ever.  They hire really lame employees and do not properly stock their supplies. ...  ... We've been here a few times and we know how McDonald's food tastes, not real great, but this one is way subpar.  I remember one time and this was over a year ago, we ordered a bunch of stuff for a family of four.  They told us they didn't have everything cook and had us pull around and wait.  We were in the drive-thru.  So, we did. ...  ... Nearly 1/2 hr goes by.  We see people enter the place and leave the place with food, but still ours wasn't done.  I finally went in and asked about it.  They said, oh, sorry.  We got the food and when I went back to the car to check, the food was fricken' cold. ...  ... Are you serious?  I went back in and asked for a refund, which they didn't want to give me a refund, but finally they did.  We left the place really hungry, no food, and very aggravated. ...  ... Several times, this was the closest McDonald's and we needed ice.  I tell you, 100% of the time, they were always out of bags of ice.  Really?  I've actually never been to a McDonald's where they ran out of ice.  If you don't sell, ice, then why advertise for it? ...  ... We honestly thought maybe they were having an off day, but there have been maybe a couple other times where we got the food and it tasted like it had been sitting for hours under some heat lamp.  Ugggh.   ...  ... So, though this McDonald's is the closest to where we live, if we need ice or some fast food, we make sure never to go to this one again.  The people are beyond unintelligent and totally lack customer service. ...  ... Whomever is the owner for this franchise needs to do a better job of selecting their people and seeing that they provide good customer service and follow good protocols as the rest of the McDonald's.   ...  ... At this point, it's a joke between my husband and I about this McDonald's and I don't even know how they stay in business.  They definitely are not following McDonald's standards for how to run a business.


Review 6: If you notice, they are always running around stressing and running around like if they were lost. I bought a steak breakfast burrito a few days ago and instead they gave me a sausage burrito. Finally, it took three times for them to get it right, how hard is that?


Review 7: The managers at this place are a bunch of ass clowns. Drive thru takes 10 min. ! You have to pull around for a cheeseburger and a coke, and there coffee machine is always getting cleaned at 6:00-7:00am. Hey dumbass, people like coffee in the Morning! Go to the one on Power and Ray. They are dialed in up there.


Review 8: Their ice cream machine seems like it's always down, don't go there if you are expecting a hot filet-o-fish sandwich.

Review 0: This place has the fastest drive thru!


Review 1: Very friendly staff and decent food. Lots of kids in the play place. Pretty nice Mcdonalds.


Review 2: I am so happy that a previous reviewer mentioned Ralph by name, because I didn't know his name but he is inspiring this review. Please keep in mind that I only go to mcdonalds a) in the morning and b) through the drive-through. The food is consistent because that's what McD does. This store doesn't mess up my order as frequently as others have. It's quick. And Ralph. Ralph is always there at the drive through, he takes your money. He is so kind that it's confusing, and he has on more than one occasion told us "Good job!" handing back our debit card. I don't know wtf we did a good job about but it's probably the first and only time you will hear that in your workday. Thanks Ralph, good job too.


Review 3: It's a McDonalds, being consistently McDonalds.  If you've ever been to McD's, you know that they all taste exactly the same (I mean that in a good way). ...  ... I would have given it 3 stars but there's this really nice lady at the window that I see all the time and she always asks how my day is. ...  ... I like that lady.  Four stars for you.


Review 4: I have been to better fast food joints. They have a TV in the main part of the resturaunt and its always on ESPN!!! Blech!!  Who wants to watch sports all the time! ...  ... The salads are never fresh! The lettuce is frozen and the tomatoes are sometimes rotten. The other thing is there are some very disruptive kids and teens who come in and talk really loud and sometimes use obscene words and leave the tables they sat at a mess. The kids think that this some kind of a free hang out joint the management either doesnt notice or doesnt care! I come here all the time for quiet and I get it sometimes but then there are the time that the outdated 50's music is too loud and kids are screaming and yelling in the playplace. Tables are not cleaned consistently and the trash is sometimes overflowing. I really liked this McDonalds but since the owners and management dont seem to care about customers I can only say that I will be finding somewhere else to go to eat, relax and use my laptop (free wi fi). The free wi fi is about the only good thing about this Mickey D's besides the nice guy at the drive thru named Ralph. ...  ... I'll check out Starbucks and see what they have to offer by way of peace, quiet, and wi fi!  Sheez!  What an embarassment! (in the words of Chef Gordon Ramsay)


Review 5: Regularly mess up your order.  Far too often ask you to pull around and forget to bring out food. One good note: Ralph in drive thru is the nicest senior citizen I've ever met!


Review 6: Today I came here like usual to use the free WiFi and get a large drink. I always sit in the area by the restrooms and the TV because there is an outlet there. The TV seems to be stuck on a channel selling jewelry! I like this McDonald's I guess but it could be modernized a bit. It needs updating a lot! In the ladies room there is currently only one stall open. the other one is locked there is no handle on the door. Imagine that! ... I think I''ll wait awhile before I come back here because maybe by then it will be updated!


Review 7: During the day this place is acceptable, just to be served by a great guy named Ralph. He is a very cool senior with such a big heart. ...  ... The reason for the one star is that the service is so bad. If you are in a hurry go to the drive thru, that is where they focus their attention and pretty much ignore the guests in the lobby. However, you will get your food fast, just accept the fact that your order might be wrong. ...  ... This McDonald's is very close to our house and we sometimes stop in late night to get ice cream from the drive through. The service at night is beyond bad. They always have a difficult time giving back the correct change, the orders are wrong.  ...  ... The one thing that really stands out is the way they shove your food order at you in the drive through. We like the ice cream cones, you would think that if I am in the drive thru in my truck and I order ice cream, that you might want to take a little bit of care in making the cone. Like clock work, they start handing me ice cream cones ( shoving at me is more like it) the cones are dripping and the ice cream is falling off the cone. I really don't want melted ice cream spilled all over, I asked for a napkin, the girl replied "there is paper around the cone"  ...  ... For some reason, I keep thinking the service will be better at night, it never is. ...  ... If you want some late night entertainment, go though the drive thru at night. You must bring your sense of humor,Don't say, I didn't warn you.


Review 8: I think this McD's is OK, but I think it could be updated a little. The TV in the main dining area is always on ESPN.  They need self serve drinks, they need a better, cleaner newer play place. I would bring my niece and nephew here, the playground is never clean and its always too noisy! Plus bigger kids come in and play (13-17 yrs. old) and I know that the little kids always clear out of the play ground because they are so scared. ...  ... I like the WiFi and I like to come here,  but I just think it could be a little more modern you know and maybe they could turn the music down a bit!  ...  ... I also think they should ask those annoying teenagers that use bad language and don't buy anything to leave and stop messing up the tables and leaving them that way.


Review 9: I was here last night(9-2-12) with my neice and nephew, they in the play place and were watching a movie. My neice was playin the play place tubes and some stupid big guy shook the tubes by holding on to part of the play equipment thet sticks out. He shook it for about 5 minutes or so. I was calling my neice to see where she was, she didnt anwer so I sent my nephew up to find her, he couldnt find her. Finally she came down and told me that when the play place was being shaken and she hit her head and became dizzy. I was not feeling good and I had to keep an eye out for my nephew so without thinking I did not report it to the manager. (I should have I know) ...  ... Just a warning to all unsuspecting parents and caregivers who come to a play place expecting a safe place to play, beware of idiots who do stupid things like shake the play place equipment! ...  ... I hope that the owners and manager read this because something needs to be done ... to keep the children who play here safe!


Review 10: I was sitting quietly using my laptop when two men came in a asked me if i owned a white SUV outside in the parking lot. A lady came out of the playplace and started out the door the men started yelling at the lady i dont know why. The men threatened to call the police and the lady in front of her kids used very obscene words loudly, such rudeness! ...  ... I think that those people should have escorted out of the place and the police shouldve been called.


Review 11: The manager of this establishment has in inability to handle complaints, maintenance issues regarding the coffee machine, and counting money correctly. This is the 4th time I have had issues with my coffee order, 1st time: they just forgot to make it; 2nd time made incorrectly: 3rd time the wrong drink was made all together.... And this time: no coffee added to the order. The same manager handled the situation each time not in a timely manner whats so ever.


Review 12: there were some kids here today who were  talking about very innappriate subjects and are not even customers. there are some kids nearby who were listening to this crap. why are the kids allowed tocome in here?


Review 13: Today I ordered a large vanilla cone and paid for it the person at the counter  said "That'll be right up for you." Well it wasn't right up and I waited for 20 minutes before they finally got around to making it for me. Another time a couple years ago i ordered an ice cream cone and the boy who was working behind the counter made the cone and set it on top the ice cream machine and let it melt. when I asked why my cone was sitting there melting he said very rudely, " oh i forgot i made it. here you go." he said and handed me the cone. "I don't want the melted cone!" I said. I was furious and even more so when I had to argue with him that he owed me a new, fresh cone. What an embarassment! C'mon McDonalds, get your stuff together!!

Review 0: Mango Pineapple Smoothies - like crack... without the nasty side effects!! ...  ... This McDonald's is super fast... like lightning! Don't ever be afraid of a long line in the drive-through. ...  ... I honestly only ever go to McDonalds for a quick drink ^^see comment above^^... or while on roadtrip for the kids (nuggets are easy, no mess, finger food in the car).


Review 1: one of the more expensive mcdonalds (they can all have different prices) not the fastest in town but the food has always been good- guess you get what you pay for! the inside is always clean so 3 stars it is. the remodel is nice.


Review 2: Review for breakfast visits only.  After the remodeling a couple years ago this place got a lot more efficient. My orders are fast, accurate, and the food is always hot.  Drive-thru moves rather well in breakfast hours.


Review 3: Leo Getz must have frequented this one.  ... "They always #$%@ in the drive through!" ... Forgot my hash browns in a Big Breakfast. -4 stars. ... Everything else was great.  +1 star. ... Eggs were not dry or over cooked.  ... Biscuit was fresh.  ... Sausage juicy.  ... Hotcakes fluffy. ... Hash browns - I wouldn't know because I didn't get them!!


Review 4: Came to the drive thru placed my order which took over 4 minutes to get correctly (so I thought correctly) because he wasn't listening. Then driving all the way home over 10 minutes to find out you can't even get the order correctly. & you refuse to fix the issue you caused.  Then you bring out your "head" manager and continue to argue with the customer. I thought the customer was always right , especially since this was YOUR fault. You don't listen, you rush me out the drive thru. Yeah let's just say this IS THE WORST MCDONALDS.


Review 5: Customer Service lacking! Cleanliness Null & Void!!!


Review 6: Only come here if your really hungry and out of options. Took over ten minutes to get my food and sent back the fries as they were room temp. Should have sent back the burger too but I was hungry at this point. Counted  five people behind the counter and two people in front of me. Horrible.

Review 0: This is one of my go-to McDonald's locations.  I'm a regular to this particular McDonald's; enough for me to be recognized by most of the staff and several of the managers.  It's got a clean interior, good prices, and, for the most part, a friendly staff.   ... I'm not a big fan of most of the food that the McDonald's franchise sells but I go to McDonald's often for their coffee and blended beverages. ... There are times when someone will get your order wrong or ring you up incorrectly, but they are very quick to resolve any issues.


Review 1: One I go to when I need my egg McMuffin fix. This location is a little dated. They have been very consistent on my orders. Staff is friendly.


Review 2: Bad store. Absolutely awful drive through. I live not too far from this location and have come to it for food over the years. Each time, over quite some time, I've been horribly disappointed by the drive-up service - today was no exception.  The food is McD's, what more need be said except that this time the burger tasted old and the fries were stale. Its one thing to wait 15 minutes when there are only two cars ahead of you and another to get crappy food once you finally get to the window.  ...  ... I've been here enough times to say with confidence: Avoid this place.


Review 3: Closed ! Probably to health inspectors .. disgusting inside , out dated , and wear junkies and bums hang out.. been many robberies here..

Review 0: I love this McDonalds mainly because of the drive thru staff, they are simply the best.  We stop here on the way to the Saguaro Ranch Dog Park for soft drinks all the time and the staff almost knows our order before we make it.


Review 1: We got there at the right time.  We were able to get a breakfast sandwich with french fries.  Our timing will probably never be that great again, but we will try, lol.  Gotta love McDonald's fries!


Review 2: Dirty restaurant! ...  ... When I walked in I was struck by how dirty the restaurant was. The floors looked like they never get mopped plus litter on them. Behind the counter the stainless needed cleaning, especially where the sundae toppings were. Most tables had trash on them. ...  ... I complained to the manager, a young dark haired girl who said she would get to it. Yeah, right... ...  ... Most of the customers 1 saw that day were using the drive thru so they would be unaware of the dirty restaurant. ...  ... I will not be back. There are plenty of other McDonalds that at least appear clean.

Review 0: Quite Breakfast. Come in morning, fast and good.


Review 1: This is the McDonald's located just inside the newly remodeled Wal-Mart on 59th ave. & Bell.  Review is for breakfast experiences only.  Service was prompt and polite, and I didn't have to explain over and over that I wanted no bacon, or have a cashier that could not figure out how to order an "egg and cheese biscuit".  Food came up fast, tasted the usual McDonald's way, and then I was off to fight the other Wal-Mart patrons (at least the lady in front of me extinguished her mini-cigar before going into Wal-mart).


Review 2: Let me start by saying I am not one to complain because I've worked in fast food before but this is ridiculous.. Hate this McDonalds. Staff is rude. And service is horrible. I went through the drive thru getting my Neice and nephew food after school and I paid the guy in cash and some change and was a dollar short so I have him my card and I got my food and got home then I got home checking my bank account to see that I got charged for the whole meal on my card and then my niece told me her sandwich wasn't there.. So I got angry not only double charged but didn't get the food. So I went back and told the manager RION (that's his name) what happened and I was friendly at first but after waiting 15 minutes for him to count the register money to see if they were over tells me they are only 8 dollars over and I could take that or nothing.. I told him I was charged 12 extra on my card after already paying in cash. And I asked for the guy who was helping me before to come up to clear the confusion and the fucking manager tells me that he's working and they would slow business down if they brought him up. First of all, the business already sucks!! If he's charging everyone double and not giving the right food. So if you must go to McDonald's then go to any other one but this.. Horrible horrible horrible people there.

Review 0: They get my coffee order right most of the time. Sometimes the cup has coffee dripping on the side which makes it messy in a car cup holder. But that is the exception fortunately.


Review 1: This McDonald's obviously isn't getting 4 stars because of its food, because based on food alone, McDonald's is a 3 star at best and I get that. ...  ... This McDonald's is a 4 star because of their employees and overall service. Even when they get busy, they have rarely messed up my order. The one time I recall them getting my order wrong, they were quick to fix it, and did not even try to give me any grief about how it was some how my fault. ...  ... The inside, bathroom, and even the kids play area are cleaner then the majority of other McDonald's I have been to. ...  ... Who ever is running this place and doing the hiring is doing a good job.


Review 2: 3 stars for the restaurant itself, quality is on par with where it should be and service is okay. ...  ... HOWEVER. ...  ... Do not, under any circumstance, go to the drive through. Absolutely every single time, my order was catastrophically wrong. I don't mean, oh they forgot the extra pickles, bummer. I mean, ordered two big macs, a snack wrap, large fry, and two mcdoubles, got two big macs, a grilled chicken sandwich, two mcnuggets, no fries, one quarter pounder....you get the point. ...  ... As if that wasn't bad enough they put the big mac together wrong. No, you read that right. They couldn't assemble a big mac. I literally mean, bun, condiments, patty, condiments, patty, and then middle bun, and bottom bun. How do you screw that up?


Review 3: Mango Pineapple Smoothies - like crack... without the nasty side effects!! ...  ... Drive-through is slower than most, and they tend to forget things like straws in bags. I hate drinking straight from the cup! The food is just like any other McDonald's ... isn't that the point?? ...  ... The kids play place at this one really sucks... like bad... like a cardboard box would be more fun. So don't bother.


Review 4: Probably 80 percent of the time my order is correct and timely, I've rarely had a problem with this place and when I have, it doesn't bother me because it is McDonald's.


Review 5: Purchased Angus CBO the sandwich had no fixings on it. I sent a note of complaint to corporate mcdonalds. for the price they charge for the burger this was unacceptable

Review 0: It's McDonalds need I say more. Inside is small but the service has always been great.  Don't ask for a Moca in the morning something is always wrong with the machine.  That seems to be the norm. Everything else is great!


Review 1: The food is McDonalds quality, you either like it or you don't, but I like that they are fast & hire very nice young people (OMG! Only old people say that, so I must be getting up there, lol). I'm giving them 4 stars because it's always a pleasant experience to go through their drive through :)  ...  ... I do have to add that their speaker was on the fritz & I did let them know. Still, it's not like I wasn't going to drive another few feet & talk to someone in person. At 5 am when I'm prepping for my long drive East, this is really not a big deal, lol.  ...  ... I've been inside & it could probably use a remodeling, but it is what it is!


Review 2: It is close to home, I love going during the week because the food and service. The service on the weekends is very slow. One night my husband and I went and it was not yet closing hours and as we drove up to the drive in they shut off the lights at the drive in and at the windows. They mix up our orders a WHOLE lot and it seems like we cannot get quality fries they are either old or cold.


Review 3: As our food was being prepared another customer was eating our fries. When the cashier was told about it, the reply was "he didn't know". Is it ok to eat other peoples food off of their trays and make excuses for it? Very disappointed.


Review 4: We go here very often cause we work near by. We always send a food runner to pick up food for about 6 of us since we work the night shift. It might just be their night shift but they are always forgetting for peoples food. ALWAYS!

Review 0: This is a great McDonalds. It has video games that the kids love. My grandkids always ask to come to this McDonald's


Review 1: I've hit more McyD's in the past week than in my entire life combined! While on a road trip from San Diego to Flagstaff I found McDonald's $.99 Diet Coke to be my best companion!  ...  ... The curb-appeal was impressive and the dual drive through was appreciated. I placed my order, "Diet Coke please" and when the kind drive-through attendance asked if I wanted to add an egg white McMuffin I gladly obliged.  ...  ... The drive through was quick and friendly. I was pleasantly surprised the egg white McMuffin was only $2 whereas in San Diego it's over $4!  ...  ... I've been impressed with the service, cost and speed I've received with McDonald's while on this trip.


Review 2: Play place under renovation. Bad wi-fi mojo.  Service should be a little better to keep the place worth coming to.


Review 3: I am absolutely disgusted in the manager Erica at this location. I took my mom to go get her senior coffee that she likes to order. When we placed her order I was going to get my usual iced mocha coffee but then Erica started interrogating us about who was with me and she asked if I had two seniors with me. She then asked me if I had ID. Seriously lady you are carding me for freaking 69 cent coffee??? I will not be returning to McDonalds after this. ( THIS IS AN OLD POST BUT FOR SOME REASON IT WAS NEVER POSTED)

Review 0: If this is the location inside the Wal-Mart, I would rather crawl across broken glass and then dive into a pool of rubbing alcohol, than eat at this location again. The managers are terrible on a good day. The employees couldn't care less about their job. The fries taste like they've been fried, frozen and then re-fried. They are horrible. EVERY TIME I GO THERE. Last time I went (my husband actually went...I was just standing there in silent protest), the manager and employees were taking pictures of each other with their cell phones. My husband stood there at the register for quite a bit while they finished screwing around, then the cashier (whose name I don't know because none of them wear name tags) reluctantly came over to help. I got the feeling he was annoyed that we interrupted him and his buddies... The husband got his food and before we made it out of the parking lot (thankfully), we realized the order was wrong and the fries were stale. Again. I so hate this location. Now I insist we go across the parking lot to the stand-alone one.


Review 1: This address is for the one next to Panda Express, not the one in Walmart. ...  ... This place sucks and it doesnt even come close to any other McDonalds. How in the world can you have so many employees working and have a line of people waiting for their food? It's like there is retarded people working there and they all have special needs. This one guys was just waiting for a happy meal and had been waiting for 10 minutes before I even got there. It them about 15 minutes for them to give me my food. One mexican kid that was working was to busy flirting with this girl in front of everyone, while her father was asking why the food was taking so long to make.  ...  ... The dining area was dirty after I got my food and sat down. They should fire the manager and everyone that works there. They take no pride in working there and its sad to see this. It shouldnt matter what they are being paid to be there, its still a job and they ARE being paid to be there.  ...  ... I will NOT be returning to this place.......

So on the way home, I decide to through the drive thur to get my lunch and something for the hubby too. ...  ... 10 McNuggets - OMG, they were HARD not crispy ... Quarter Pound with cheese - Ok, the buns were a little hard ... McDouble with cheese - Hubby, same taste and the bun was soft ... Fries are GOOD! ...  ... Do not know if it is this location or an off day for McD's.


Review 1: The casher handled money and made my order without washing her hands, Yuck!!

Review 0: Out on errands today, I stopped into this McDonald's just for a snack.  The service was fast & friendly, the dining room clean, comfortable and very nicely decorated.  I loved my treat too...  just a delicious, large size soft ice cream cone for $1.19. ...  ... "So if it was so great, where's the 5th Star?" you ask.  WELL, I'm glad you asked that!     :-) ...  ... They had air blowers only in the bathroom, no paper towels, and an exit door that opens IN.  That leaves you trying to get toilet paper or maybe an ass gasket to get out of there with your hands still clean unless you luck out & someone else opens the door just at the right time, which happened for me.  In any case, this is NOT OK!  What good does it do for them to tell employees to wash their hands & wear gloves if they're going to ignore this important health issue?  Minus one Star.     :-)


Review 1: It a McDonalds..... how much can i say?!  Anyways, its a newly updated location that is very clean and modern looking unlike the older McDonalds that are out there. The drive-thru has 2 lanes, so there is never a large wait and the service is friendly!


Review 2: Its McDonalds!   Not that fast here so go in side cause the drive thru is a mess.


Review 3: I went through the drive thru to buy my daughter and I some lunch. She had gotten a kid happy meal with apple juice and I had gotten a snack rap with a drink. The cashier who took my payment was friendly and fun and took my payment quickly. Now the woman at the second window where I got my food. Talk about not friendly and kinda rude. She didn't say one word to me not even hi. She handed me my food and then immediately shut the window. Now I know they are busy but still where is the hospitality? She even forgot my daughters apple juice and I had to waive down the lady to get her juice. If I have to go to this mcdonalds again im definately going inside and avoiding the drie thru staff by all means!


Review 4: I went to this location, late night around 3am, and left the drive thru window around  3:30am. The clerk was chit chatting with his friends/family member for almost 30 mins. Cars were lined up, and waiting. Late night service was an absolute disaster.


Review 5: This location literally is down the street from me and I used to frequent it all the time when I still believed I could inject/inhale pure fat + NOT work out and never gain any weight.  Needless to say, I haven't been to this location for the longest time until a few weeks ago to pick up some for my brother.  It hasn't changed.   ...  ... Same old disrespectful, careless tards working the drive thru.  When I pull up to the window to get my food, the person handing me my food just stares at me.  Not a "hello", not a "thank you", not a "have a nice day" ......I'm not expecting you to CARE but part of the etiquette of working in food service is to not look like your best friend just died and least say hello to the customer.   ...  ... One time I asked for a large Dr. pepper and I was handed a small one.  So I told the girl working the window that she gave me the wrong size, in which she proceeded to snatch the drink from me without  an apology or any type of acknowledgement and then yelled very loudly and nastily at someone (while the drive thru window was open) "YOU DIDN'T TELL ME SHE WANTED A LARGE?"  Then pops back out the window and asks me "You wanted a large drink?"   YES MOTHAFUCKA.  That's what I just told you!  Ugh wthhhh.  I wouldn't be surprised if she spat in my drink.   ...  ... My most recent trip?  I know I'm Asian but I'm told all the time and know for a fact that I have ZERO asian accent  - SO please tell me why when I placed my order, the person inside acted like I barked out the equation for a hyperbole? ...  ... They have hoodrats working in this joint.  These people should quit and sell drugs instead.


Review 6: Yep I work in the ghetto...although this shopping center and the surrounding area is new it's still the ghetto... This place has to be the slowest "fast food" place ever!! Ordered the breakfast with hot cakes...the hot cakes were rubbery and of course they forgot to put the condiments in the bag... Well you know what they say..the screw you in the drive through... This place sucks and a shame there aren't any others down the street to go to.

Review 0: I moved to this area in 2003 and have been coming here ever since. There have been some times that the crew wasn't at their sharpest, and one period of about a year when there was a language barrier (I always had to check before I drove off to see if my Diet Coke was really a Dr. Pepper), but overall, it's been very good. And ALWAYS very, very clean, which is what I *really* want in a restaurant.  ...  ... The food is typical McDonalds. I've never had a cold or stale sandwich or fries, and whenever there's something wrong, it's always fixed quickly.  ...  ... Now, as for "quickly" .. please consider that people can only move and food can only cook so fast. I usually go during breakfast & lunch, and while it's very busy, they usually have a full kitchen. There are only one or two cashiers, but if you pile up too many orders, there's more of a chance to get it wrong.  ...  ... Saturdays are CRAZY busy, I try not to go then! Sometimes I really, really need a Filet 'O Fish, but I know what it'll be like, so I'm not surprised if I'm waiting forever.  ...  ... And Shane M ... is it really fair to rate this one McDs so low when you get sick at ALL of them? I've noticed that on other restaurants I've reviewed, too; food allergies are a real problem these days, perhaps it's not "karma".  ...  ... Anyway, if you like McDonald's, it's a good one, but busy. They do great birthday parties, and the people are very nice. If you don't like McDonald's, there's an awesome KFC right there!


Review 1: The dining area is really small!  I still put this McD's better than the one in Buckeye.  We actually had a pretty nice experience dining in.  The cashier was really nice.


Review 2: I took my children in one morning because they wanted to visit their play-land.  They do have a awesome play- land for kids. I was disappointed when I had ordered some chicken nuggets during breakfast hours for my kids and their manager refused to make them.  I have worked for this company in the past and their policy is to make fried products all day.  When I questioned it the manager said " It's not our policy".  She had no name tag on of course, but was a heavy older women that was just plain rude.  This is a corporate store, there are several other McDonald's in the area that are more friendly.


Review 3: *  Very dirty dinning area!! ... *  Employees obviously do not care about customer service  ... *  McDonalds should pull their affiliation - very bad representation of the brand


Review 4: Avoid the drive thru.!!!! They never get the order right.  ...  ... Here is a list of other problems. ... -they serve expired food ..pies with date stamps from 2days earlier. ... -tables are rarely clean ... -drinks are watery ... -employees are not friendly ... -managers don't care and seem to even encourage poor servce. ...  ... ...i could go on and on, but why waste my time with these fools.


Review 5: Burger was thrown in the box and the entire thing was overlooked. Never go here


Review 6: Definately not service with a smile. Order is usually wrong, and workers are rude.


Review 7: I absolutely HATE this McDonalds. It has the most incompetent, slow employees EVER! Almost every time I go there to get a $1 soda, and iced coffee, or something to eat with my kids, it is an agonizing process whether in the drive thru or in the restaurant. I try to avoid this location even though it is 2 blocks from my house. This location has been this way for at least 2 years.....no hope for it changing any time soon...


Review 8: I moved to the area a year ago.  I've been to this McDonalds drive up a few times.  Maybe it's just bad luck, but these guys have never got the order right and half the time I have to park and wait.  Can't even call the management to complain, no answer.  I have an answer for them.  You're out of chances. I will drive out of my way to find another McDonalds that has their act together.

Review 0: I've never had a problem with this place. They have always gotten my order correct, and the vast majority of the time, the employees are smiling, at least at the drive-thru.


Review 1: Ordered two small smoothies and a vanilla latte. She asked me, "hot or iced?" and I said, "iced - no, HOT." After waiting almost ten minutes, I finally saw them set two smoothies and an iced latte on the counter. Telling the guy behind the counter that it was supposed to be hot just got me a skeptical look and a request to see my receipt. So they had rung it up wrong - and after another wait, I finally got my hot latte. Which was anything but hot. It was cooler than tap water. So I took it back and asked for another. That one wasn't as "hot" as the first one. "Can you nuke it?" "No." "Are they always this lukewarm?" "Yes." Asked for my money back.


Review 2: This place is neither here nor there. It is McDonalds. You get what you get. I usually don't have many problems with them. I set the bar low. ...  ... Its good food when I don't need to be impressed :)


Review 3: i have no idea why this McDonalds can "NEVER" get your order correct.  We have come here probably 4 times thru the drive thru, not one single time have I came home with my correct order.   You would think I would learn to check it before driving home.  Truly amazing how the person on drive thru had to get my simple order 2 times over the speaker, and once again at the first window.....and yet, wrong.   I didn't think that 2 cheeseburgers with no pickles, and a 6 piece mcnugget was crazy to think they could get it right


Review 4: We stopped here on our way to Cali, went thru drive-thru, service was good we did receive what we ordered, BUT the fries were cold!! Chicken nuggets had been sitting out for a bit nothing seemed to be fresh...I know it's fast food but does it have to be cold food too?


Review 5: IF they get your order right your lucky. If it is right most of the time the burgers are made wrong. ... Not worth the stop at all.


Review 6: Mystery meat and velveeta cheese breakfast burrito, served by employees obese from their own fare, guaranteed to scald your mouth and make you sick.


Review 7: Stay away poor service rude staff have no idea how to be professional screaming to one another and still have we wrong food


Review 8: The service is so bad the drive threw takes so long they should not even be classified as fast food I am not sure how it takes them 5min a car just to end up getting everything wrong


Review 9: This McDonalds is terrible long wait times stale food horrible customer service will never eat their again.


Review 10: We are a household full of workers and college students so we do get a good feel for the fast food restaurants in Maricopa. Its not good for us and its probably not our only options but its the easiest. I Dont normally have an issue with costumer service but the drive thru is usually different. They can be rude and degrading. The main problem I had though happened the last time I went there. The guy in the first window took my order roludly kept asking "is that all" and became annoyed when I kept ordering. I was making an order for over five people in my house that evening and when I pulled up he made rude comments about my weight. Yes I am very over weight and jot happy about it. But for him to take my order for five people and accuse me of ordering it all for myself is just hurtful and uncalled for. When I made a complaint the gentleman informed me of his name. When I contacted management for make a formal complaint and the manager kept smiling and laughing while my mother (who had to go down because I was very embarrassed) explained the situation. As the person who was insulted I wasn't put to get him fired but I felt action needed to be taken. The manager informed my mom that he was sent home for the week. But after finding out that he had made several rude comments to other customers she felt further action needed to be taken. The manager could only smile and say that he isn't the usual manager and he has no power. The actual manager attempted to contact us once and said if we wanted it resolved would call him back. Very incorporate situation that should have never occurred.

Review 0: We just got ice cream cones as a family and the workers were awesome!!! We asked for extra large cones and they definitely made them XL! Fast service for a quick, cheap treat!


Review 1: I eat McDonald's probably 1-2 times a year, but sometimes you just crave a double quarter pounder with cheese. Ya know? This one is across the street from my part-time, so it's usually a waited-way-too-long-to-eat-lunch-now-I'm-starving-and-I-want-food-right-meow trip.


Review 2: I can't say I'm a huge fan of McDonald's in general. But this location is literally right across the street... so sometimes when I'm feeling lazy, I'll grab some grub there. ...  ... Normally I'd give McDonalds 2 stars, but today when I stopped by here with the boyfriend... we waited. And waited. The boyfriend decided to go up to the counter to inquire about our order and not only did they apologize multiple times, but they gave us free large fries and 2 free apple pies. ...  ... So, thanks McDonalds! I like free food. :)


Review 3: I think I may have food poisoning after eating here 4-5 hours ago. Achy joints, running to the bathroom, chills... Friggin' McDonalds.

Review 0: After working in this area for a long time coming to this McDonalds used to be kind of scary. You didn't want to venture to the doors because of the bums that hung around outside begging for food or money.  ...  ... But today as I am sitting here I can honestly say WOW they did an amazing job on the remodel. They even took away the outdoor section where the bums used to be. The manager is walking around asking how everyone is and that's a great thing! Give this McDonald's another shot guys!


Review 1: Love McDonald's Ice Coffee drinks.


Review 2: Pretty simple to make my kids happy with the consistent goodness off a couple hot cakes in the morning. Thanks Ronald!


Review 3: I'm guilty of eating at this place a time or two before but this time it was lucky enough to be full from lunch & meeting a colleague to handle business. Families-it's got a playground for ya. It's always looked a little rundown (to me) so I can only assume that's why they're doing a renovation. No drive thru for the time being so if your in a hurry skip to the next one. There is access tho on the north side so if this is your jam good luck on parking. I'm sure I'll post another review after the renovation is complete. Food wise.....well it's McDonalds, eat at your own risk, hahahaha


Review 4: Ok, Ed's gonna get after me 'cause I went to a McDonalds.  But I was thirsty from dinner and wanted to try the Holiday Mint McFlurry.  It wasn't as good as I'd hoped.  It was just their basic vanilla soft serve with a dash of mint flavoring and some red and green chocolate chips mixed in enough to be bit sized.  It wasn't creamy.  It was too thick to drink.  And it was really chewy.  I wish I'd left the Filipino restaurant in time to make it to Ritas Custard instead.  Then at least I'd have the creamy goodness of Frozen Custard.  ...  ...  I have to say the young man who served me was excellent, though.  I didn't get his name and it wasn't on the receipt, unless "KS#3" was him.  He greeted me nicely as I walked in, answered my questions, took my order, made my drink, acknowledged the customers waiting behind me, and even checked with me twice while I was sitting if I was happy with the drink.  Pretty good service for a $2 drink.  I think this kid will go far.  He's the reason I'm giving the place three stars instead of two. ...  ... Overall everything was pretty clean, too.


Review 5: Typical Mcdonald's, food always tastes the same, people are always friendly, and drive thru is always fast.  French fries have been fresh almost every time too. Love the sausage egg mcmuffins.


Review 6: I drive out of my way so I dont go to this Mcdonalds! How can you seriously get the same order wrong 5 times. A manager was yelling and very unprofessional with a new and training employee. It's dirty and BAD SERVICE


Review 7: Nice on the inside but employees and other customers are not pleasant. Recommend staying away.


Review 8: This McDonalds is one of the worst I have ever been to. There are always transients outside begging for money. Many of them approach you at your car or follow you out of the building. The food is decent but the line is always long. The staff has little common sense. They refuse to give you a drink cup after you have paid and make you wait until your food is ready. This is especially inconvenient because of the terrible drink station layout with no where to put your food. Also don't bother asking for a free cup of water. They give you a cup which is smaller than what you get in a kids meal. Avoid this McDonald's at every opportunity!

Review 0: the staff is always nice! I take my dog through the drive thru all the time. They pet him and sometimes even give him a french fry! which makes his day. My orders are always special and they always get it right!


Review 1: Its McDonalds. With a playplace. It was clean.


Review 2: Busy location, average service & speed.


Review 3: Service usually sucks. Two order spots but never used. Coming in and out is so narrow surprised not more accidents.


Review 4: I had 2 options for water a tiny 6 oz cup (yeah right) or pay full price (cost of pop) for a glass of water. Customer service is lost on the managers here. These are the basics and I'm tired of it.


Review 5: You can expect: cold fries , gross or uncarbonated drinks , cold burgers that have been sitting there ect. I usually don't write reviews but with flu , fever , and gross food; I'll be going hungry tonight.  ... Save yourself a trip and go to Ellsworth.

Review 0: Yeah, yeah, I know, two McDonalds in one week??  There's something wrong with this picture.  But this one wasn't my fault.  My daughter was interviewing a potential child care person and they met there.  She had asked me to come along and give a second opinion.  Which was a thumbs down.   ...  ... One reason for picking McDonalds was because of the play area so my two year old grandson would have something to do since he was coming, too.  Oh, and guess who had to climb up the indoor slide to talk him down when he went too high, lost sight of me, got scared, and started crying.  TWICE.  You got it.  But he loved it and I got my exercise in for the evening chasing him all over the place and keeping him out of the kitchen.  His favorite place to head for in restaurants these days.  And I got a mint hot chocolate.  Fancy name is Mocha Mint or something. ...  ... Oh, and firsties on reviewing the place.


Review 1: Does one have to give 1 star?  This is the worst Macdonalds in the Valley. Avoid it if you can.  Worst management & staff imaginable and all follows from that.


Review 2: I'm only giving one star because I have to. They don't have ice cream seriously? What kind of mcdonalds doesn't have that. We won't be back..

Review 0: Employees work incredibly hard to satisfy customer needs. They deserve more than minimum wage. Also, the cute brunette guy "Eric" I believe is a stud! Charming too!


Review 1: How wonderful and delightful my lunch be! I had Asian Chicken grilled salad.  Fun place for kids. The have a nice play area.


Review 2: The fries were a little soggy, but still good. Dr. Pepper was excellent!!!


Review 3: Clean inside, seems to have been remodeled recently. Same mediocre service, average chain location.


Review 4: Day I went service was extremely slow.


Review 5: Dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb...dumb, dumb, dumb, dum, dummmmmmmbbbbb. Waited in line for-ev-er cuz the sensor didn't pick up our truck. So, we proceeded to the window to place our order & had to tell the girl 3 times that we wanted a Mc-gridd-le, real slow like so they'd understand English, or so we hoped. But alas, it shan't be. They even had it correct on the receipt, but nay, I tell you, nay. The screwed it up afterall.


Review 6: I think I gave this place 6 chances....SIX!  sounds ridiculous, I know.  I guess I suck at life.  I bet this place hasn't served a fresh chicken nugget in months... ...  ... If by some act of God, they do happen to deliver some freshly-prepared delicious bits of saturated fat, they know what they have done, and they HATE you for it. ...  ... If you're in phoenix or the surrounding areas, fast-food in the summertime is a hot-bed for food-borne illness.  Just look at the front page article in today's Arizona Republic.


Review 7: They suck their slow and everbody else is eating while you wait for your fucking food bitches

Review 0: Average McDonald's chain.


Review 1: I've been to this location several times and have never had an especially bad experience.  The service is kinda slow, especially in the dining room because the drive through is always busy and they get priority.  There's just not a lot of room to wait around while they are making your order and they are on to taking the next one.  The playground is nice and seems clean but I have no idea how often they clean it.  Overall it's a pretty average McDonald's.


Review 2: Just stopped in for a pancakewich for me & my little lady, smoothie for my baby & mocha frappe for me. Quality of food, considering its McDonalds, was good in comparison to other McDonalds. Drive-Thru personnel was friendly. It was a good start to our morning


Review 3: This is my first time back to this location after multiple bad experiences.  I have spoken with a member of the upper management team and I feel that he really doesn't care that I'm complaining about his service.  I have been told by this individual that since he doesn't see it, he doesn't believe it actually happens, or that the employee in question is having an off day.  She seems to have a lot of them.  He also doesn't believe in the reviews that are being posted on sites such as Yelp, foursquare or other social media sites.  It's view as a way for complainers to complain, yet I see a lot of positive reviews. ...  ... The fact that they close down an access point on Saturday nights due the car show and then again on Sunday evenings for their deliveries, makes getting into the parking lot a bit of a hassle, but that is what it is. ...  ... So I don't go hear as often as I once did, but that is my choice.


Review 4: Customer service is getting WORSE. So many staff, yet they can't stop texting to wait on more than one person at a time . SAD.

Review 0: Avoid at all costs. Order accuracy is nonexistent. Spent 10 minutes waiting for drive-thru order that was all wrong. Watched two customers ahead of me have the same issue. If you want a mystery order, try the drive-thru!


Review 1: I typically visit this McDonald's and am a regular due to the Playland, my daughter and the Arizona heat. As of late, they have been completely lacking in the Customer Service end. My latest visit left me quite displeased. I waited 15 mins for my order and when it finally was ready, my frys were  missing. After pointing out the issue, I had to wait an additional 5 minutes. I got over it, big deal. But then my daughter asks me for an icecream cone so I go to order. As I approach the register another patron enters and is behind me. When this happens the manager and employee completely overlook me standing there placing my order and service the patron after me. At this point I am shocked and appauled. I decide to express my frustration to the assistant manager who offer me a very lackluster apology. Avoid this place if you can help it.

Review 0: This McDonalds never disappoints.


Review 1: Double drive thru. Good service.


Review 2: For a McyD's I'm a fan but just for the ambiance. This is a bloody nice McDonald's - Wood-like accents, fireplace, lovely tables. We stopped on our way out to the lake for a quick breakfast. The food was...well...McDonald's but it was a lovely place to buy this food.  ...  ... I had the yogurt & fruit and shocked how small it was! But when I ate it I couldn't finish it so it was fine. The boys had egg mcmuffin, sausage biscuit, & the mcgriddle thingy (he didn' t care for it).  ...  ... But if I have to eat at McDonald's this is the one I would frequent.


Review 3: Some of the best drive through iced tea around :)


Review 4: The food is usually fine. However, we use the drive through at least once a week and I would say that 1/3 to 1/2 the time something is wrong or missing from the order. Make sure to check your bags before driving away.


Review 5: The people that run the drive thru are a joke. Apparently it is really difficult to understand that someone wants a large coffee and not a small. They also do not make any attempt to make it right for any of the times I've been there and they have messed up my order.  I filled out a survey online -let's see if anybody from the store actually follows up as I have requested them to!


Review 6: This McDonald has useless workers who don't listen when taking an order.  It's not that had to push a button that says no onions on a cheeseburger. If I hadn't looked my son would had eaten onions that he is not able to eat. Great job McDonalds for trying to kill my son. Get real employees that listen when taking an order, then just there for a pathetic check.

Review 0: It's McDonald's. It's not like it's Wendy's across the street, but this location isn't as bad as everyone else is posting. Some times I might treat myself to fries and a chocolate dipped cone. ...  It's always been clean when I was there. I am disappointed that they remodeled. I liked the extra booths they use to have and the cozy "coffee house" type of layout they used to have. It's more open now, though. Just something to get used to.  ... The staff are decent. Nothing spectacular stands out.


Review 1: Horrible dry and bad smelling burgers. Tried the Angus deluxe as well as the Grilled BBQ chicken wrap. Both were dry and tasted like foam, but smelt of rotten carcass. Mea Culpa for trying McDees...


Review 2: Horrid! The girl at the drive thru told me it was 60 cents for ranch and I was purchasing 3 chicken nugget combos with fries... Are you reaaaaally that cheap mcdonalds?! NEVER AGAIN I have ... Never heard of a fast food chain charging for all of your ranches, fuck you mcdonalds you stingy a$$ FUCKERS truly fuck you


Review 3: The food was dry and tasted like it had been a couple of days old or more. very displeased !!!

Review 0: I don't eat McDonald's,  but every Friday I take my little brother here after school for a treat. The employees are friendly and efficient,  the facilities are always clean,  and my little brother always leaves happy.   ...  ... It's McDonald's... It's fast food. I would recommend eating something healthier,  but if you need to satiate your fast food craving... This is as good a place as any.


Review 1: I usually don't give fast food restaurants over 3 stars, but this place deserve an extra star because they filled up my strawberry milkshake all the way to the top, not 80% full like other place does with the excuse of "oh, we did this by the weight".  You filled it up because people paid money for it.  If you are giving it out for free, then maybe you can use that stupid excuse.  Props for their fast service too.


Review 2: I rarely go to McDonald's but I needed quarters for laundry so I stopped in this one, located inside the Riverview Center Wal-Mart, and ordered something I've had a few times before, a small Ranch Chicken Wrap, formerly $1.49, currently $1.89.  I was impressed it tasted very fresh for being fast food and the chicken piece inside it was the real deal, not some reformed "meat".  The worker was very nice about giving me change from a five in quarters, about $3 worth.  So I had a nice little snack for cheap and got the change I needed.  No complaints here.


Review 3: Pretty fast in the mornings, don't go after noon. Even in the morning you can get sloppy and not always fresh product. This bothers me because I don't expect much out of a place like McDs but to not even be able to put hot burgers out is just sad. I stopped today to get a coke. Had to go in because their drive line was too backed up... At 1230p....


Review 4: Crappy customer service and management that was there when incident occurred didn't seem approachable. Went online and did survey and requested someone get in touch with me about the situation...that was a week ago and still nothing. Had gone through the drive thru and got a lady who rudely said yeeeeeeeah.. When I asked, ma'am are you ready for my order? And she continued to ask after I ordered each item (in a cocky manner) if that "was it". I understand it's fast food, but for crying out loud, some BASIC mannerisms and customer service would come in handy. Wish I could rate this a negative star!


Review 5: This place is a joke!  Went through the drive thru at 9:00 for a soda and ice cream cone and was told the ice cream machine was already turned off.  Was offered a cup of ice cream from the freezer.  Kind of takes the whole "soft" out of soft served ice cream. ...  ... I have have no faith in local franchise owners caring much about anything other than the money they make, I contacted the corporate office so hopefully they'll do something about this situation.

Review 0: It's one of the few places in the area that is open late. Staff is the best I have ever seen at any McDonald's in my  ... Life.....and I've traveled the country!  ...  ... One morning I ordered only a large water, expecting to pay 50 cents or something, and they gave it to me for free, large and filled with ice. In Arizona, you learn to appreciate that...


Review 1: I'm about a twice a year McDonalds guy.  I'll occasionally stop for coffee or an ice cream cone at the drive through but I rarely go inside.  The first Mickey D's urge of the year hit us this weekend and we decided to have lunch. ...  ... I've been in this McDonalds a couple of times.  Honestly, it's one of the nicer ones around, probably anywhere. Very nice tables, nice stone flooring, great color scheme, you get the message.  My one complaint every time I'm here is that the drink/condiment area is an absolute disaster! Complete disgusting mess!  They do a pretty good job of keeping the tables bussed and clean but always forget about the condiment area.  The ketchup dispenser is either out of ketchup or such a mess that you don't want to use it and the little cups for the ketchup are either out or you have to dig them out of the holder with a tweezer.  One last request, any chance you could offer sweet and low for the ice tea? (It's the pink packet) ...  ... I had the new grilled chicken bacon clubhouse sandwich. Honestly, it was terrific!  For once it actually looked exactly like the picture and was put together with some pride of ownership.  It was delicious! The fries were hot and fantastic which is good because they have a half life of about 19 seconds so I scarfed them as fast as I could. ...  ... The counter staff was nice and we got our food relatively quickly, overall, a nice place to have a quick fast food lunch.


Review 2: Mango Pineapple Smoothies - like crack... without the nasty side effects!! ...  ... They forgot my straw - and 5 min wait to make a smoothie.... when I was the only one in drive-through? Booooo


Review 3: Came in at 6 am. Drove through the drive through first to even see if they were open. They were! I went inside and they said I was drunk and to get out, refused me service and were very rude. I had not been drinking, I am 19 years of age and was heading to work at Target with my uniform on. The manager with the tattoos on her arms said she would call the police if I ever came back because I was "crazy stupid for going through a drive through and deciding to come inside". I hope this place falls through just because of this incident. I called corp and let them know.


Review 4: My son's request for his birthday was "Old McDonald's"  so since my wife refuses I sucked it up and came here Saturday.  I am not a fan of McDonald's or a fan of what it represents, I have respect for Ray Krock but that is about it and I am not sure he would be proud of what he serves today either.  I hope the franchisee doesn't hate me for this review but since McDonald's targets kids with its toys (I know I used to love to go to this place too as a kid) then it gives me no choice but to speak the truth because I am a loyal Yelper that has kids.  My children of course ordered chicken nugget happy meals so they can get the stupid toy.  I made them get the apples and apple juice.  I had not been here in so many years that I noticed an Angus burger that was now on the menu and looked good in the picture.  Of course it was dry and bland, the fries here are always good but I have since learned that they are not exactly 100% potato so there you go.  I pretty much felt like crap when I left but I wanted to not keep my kids always wondering about this place with the desire to go inside.  Next time if he makes the request I will buy a slice of pizza from Barro's across the way and just eat that while my kids eat here.  Sorry McD's your food doesn't do it for me.


Review 5: Only 2 things bring me to McDonald's, the coffee and.cheap desert. I do give credit for McDonald's on how they operate like a machine. They get you in and out, but unfortunately not this one. 10 minutes for a cup of coffee? Only 4 tables in the place and every single table got up to complain about their food quality, missing food etc. Where's management? Obviously they didnt graduates from hamburger u.


Review 6: Service sooooooo poor!!!! Stopped this morning, 6/25/13. Manager looked at me, and even didn't come to window!!!!! What time they open? 5 am? Well I was there 5:10!!!!!

Review 0: I LOVE this McDonalds! Awesome service, friendly smiles & great tasting food. I alter every order I make here (b/c I'm picky) and it's ALWAYS correct, I never have to send it back or go in from the drive thru b/c it's wrong.  ...  ... I have been coming to this location for probably 2 years and I've seen staff promoted and it's so awesome. I can't say enough good things about this mcdonalds. Keep up the great work you guys!!! :)


Review 1: I'd give this place 3 stars but the drive through line was about 12 cars deep, so we went inside.  It took 10 minutes to get our food after ordering.  Coulda been a bad night or a bad time (9:30pm) but this isn't the first time the lines have been really long here.   ...  ... Food is normal, wait is not.


Review 2: Right now to give this place two stars right now I will check back later, it extremely busy and they're filled with teenagers because McDonald's here is between two schools so lots of noxious loud teenagers in the afternoon on some mornings the weekend has a little bit better but the accuracy if you order is really bad I'll try it again later possibly but never too much problem in the drive-through seems to be very fast and a lot more accurate than on the inside.


Review 3: This McDonald is renovated again. It is always packed,  drive thru is slow, difficult parking arrangement and currently impossible to drive and park. I cant even count how many times my order has been messed up here. A complete disappointment.

Review 0: Best McDobalds I've ever been to. There fries are always fresh. They have messed up my order only once but they knew right away when I went through the drive thru.  All other McDonalds are ruined for me.


Review 1: I recommend this McDonald's over the Jack-in-the-Box nearby (see my review). Service here is consistent with the occasional hiccup associated with fast food places (e.g., wrong burger or no sauce). Occasionally you get someone working the window who fails to greet you and seems to be in a bit of a trance. However, the service is generally good and you are "in and out" (drive-thru or inside) in little to no time.  ...  ... All-in-all: Good place to eat with generally good service.


Review 2: Service has always been fast and correct. No errors in the drive through yet.  Inside is clean and for the most part the employees are friendly.

Review 0: Standard McDonalds. Clean, friendly staff. Quick drive through service. Yummy smoothies & hot fudge sundaes


Review 1: 1 1/2 stars? I don't think it was that bad. Food was served hot, the bun was not a hockey puck and it did not take a long time to come out.  ...  ... Are expectations for fast food increasing that much?


Review 2: McDonald's currently under construction.   ...  ... Hopefully they retain the staff after it is complete.  Fairly friendly and typical service.  This was the only McDonald's I knew that served burgers all day.


Review 3: awful, bugs, flies everywhere.  DIRTY.   You will get bug bites, food not cooked, and  ... workers and management are rude.


Review 4: Horrible. Worst McDonald's ever. I don't understand how the "machines" can always be broken. I stop for a hot chocolate, but no the machine is broken. I stop for a smoothie, but no the machine is broken. I stop for a cookie, but no the machine is broken. I stop for a sundae, but no the machine is broken. I wonder if the machines are really always broken or if these people are just idiots. Officially done with this place.


Review 5: I always enjoyed this place prior to its remodel. The staff was always nice,Now I must say its the worst McDonald's EVER! They never seen to get my order right, food is always cold and never fresh. For all who want to complain I finally was able to get a correct phone number. (602-404-9785) Spoke to the so called manager Mariciela, while I was explaining the situation she was not even paying attention just giggling while I was speaking. Didn't seem to even care. NEVER AGAIN WILL I GO HERE FOR ANYTHING, EVEN IF ITS FREE. Just wish I could give a negative stars.


Review 6: I usually don't take the time to review fast food restaurants this one deserve it customer service is awful the food is awful the drinks as well are awful how can you mess with a drink I don't know ask them. They are always busy but yet Lack customer service I don't think I've ever gone to McDonalds that is as horrible as this one enough said will not return


Review 7: Stay away at all costs. The last couple of trips thru the drive thru, everytume the order has been wrong. Of course you dont find this out till you get home. Diet Coke given instead of regular coke(which was ordered) and they are very stingy with the fries. Always 1/2 filled. Drive up to Burger King right up the street.


Review 8: This has to be the worst McDonalds I've been to in 20 years... and I've eaten at many bad Micky D's. ...  ... Food is always cold and old.  Orders are correct about 50% of the time.  Employees are always rude.  Such a shame.  I've just moved to the neighborhood and unfortunately this is "my McDonalds". ...  ... But it's not completely hopeless.  My previous McDonalds in Fort Lauderdale was a poorly managed franchise too.  A couple of complaints to corporate headquarters fixed that place in a jiffy!  Don't bother calling the franchise, look for the corporate complaint number on your bag and call.  Franchisees HATE when you call corporate headquarters and they will be forced to improve or risk losing their franchise.


Review 9: Worst McDonald's ever. It's not the fact that they can never seem to get my order right, but trying to get it corrected is more hassle than its worth. Food is usually cold anyway. But it's  their management that's the worst. They treat you like the idiot, when it's their fault to begin with. If you call the posted customer service number, don't bother it's a recording and still have not received a callback. Avoid at all costs.

Review 0: The best in the business . Always spotless friendly fast and tasty. Good drive thru access and rite turn onto the highway.


Review 1: Usually pretty fast and the people are polite, the food is typical McDonalds fare (I do like the grilled wraps though). This location is always clean and well kept as well. Overall not bad


Review 2: Employees complaining about you for a custom order when you drive up, take over 8 minutes to bring it, act offended again when you tell them that they got the order wrong, and then hesitate to correct the problem. The sad part is we have run I to similar problems with this location several times.


Review 3: I have never gotten the correct order here, and the DT wait is horrendous. I go there weekly to buy ice & I often wait between 7-12 minutes in the drive-thru line. Inside is usually overrun by unsupervised 13 yr olds.

Review 0: McDonalds at this location donated the breakfast for "The Run for the Wall".  Check out www.rftw.org.  Thank you for your contribution to our nations Veterans!


Review 1: Stopped in for lunch during work. Employees friendly. Restroom dirty and a homeless guy sleeping at one of booths under the tv.


Review 2: They are right off the 10 and 51st ave. I've only gone here for drive thru while I'm on lunch at work. Been here a few times. The employees are really cheerful compared to other McDonalds I've been too. They are quite generous here with napkins and sauces lol. No complaints really. Free wifi is awesome too while waiting in line at the drive thru :p

Review 0: As far as fast food, this place won all the stars. We didn't use the restroom, so I do not know how nice or clean they are, but we were in a hurry and this place fit the bill. ...  ... It looks pretty new an neat, I kind of liked the decor. ...  ... Our cashier Cathy was super nice and friendly, we used a coupon from the Entertainment Book and it was a breeze. ...  ... I took a few steps and it felt like our food was ready within seconds... We had found a nice table and we eat really fast, overall I estimate we spent like 10 minutes there and our order and food must have taken like 2 minutes -see my review about JIB, by Cave Creek and Beardsley : ( ...  ... Also, I admire people that are attentive to their customer's needs, while we were getting our drinks, I overheard another cashier (Sofia I think) ask a group of customers if they wanted an extra chair, and think she went and got them one from a table nearby... I thought that was really nice. ...  ... Also, when I got my coffee the lady that gave it to me made sure I got the cream and sugar I needed (I had a bad experience with this on the McDonalds at Cave Creek and Beardsley once, where they ask you when you place the order and we left just for me to find out my coffee had no cream, no sugar : ( ...  ... Also, there was a long line at the drive-through, and some times we have had an issue in other places where they help the drive through customers really fast and those that went inside have to wait longer... Does not seem to be an issue here.


Review 1: Exemplary customer at drive thru. Very friendly. Great food.


Review 2: I love this location.  Everyone is really nice.  And the speed of the service is amazing.  You may be the 7th car in the drive-thru, but you will place your order, pay, and receive your food in 5 minutes.  Same goes for when you're inside.  There is limited seated inside, but there's usually not a long line and you get helped and served right away.  Right now I live within walking distance, but if I moved further away and there was another McDonald's that was closer to me, I would still go out of my way to go to this one.


Review 3: Okay, the 5 stars is for one thing and one thing only. My diet coke first thing in the morning. I don't know why McDonald's diet cokes are so good, but they are the best fountain cokes around. ...  ... This location is nice in the early mornings to get in and out. Be careful later in the day as the drive thru gets very congested due to the location.


Review 4: This is the best Mcdonalds I have ever been to.  I have never been inside of it, but in the mornings they always have me in and out of the drive thru in under 5 minutes on my way to work.  Often with 6-8 cars in front of me.  Very efficient.


Review 5: This, ladies and gentlemen, is what fast food is supposed to be like. Unhealthy but prompt : ) ... Stopped here for breakfast on our way to the zoo (volunteering and almost late). We decided to go inside but order to go. 2 minutes, tops. ...  ... Hubby got his drink, we stopped back by the counter, I made a comment about the bad idea for the McCrap name (McWrap), and done was our food. We got it and left. ...  ... Fast, easy, good parking, friendly service.


Review 6: For fast food, list location is pretty nice. They get you in and out pretty quickly and I've never had a problem with the food. It also feels cleaner than most fast food restaurants I've been to. Maybe because it's a fairly newer location. My son would give it five stars because he loves their happy meals. I like their grilled chicken wraps a lot and their coffee is also very good. When I'm craving iced tea you can't beat their $1 pricing. Overall I'm a fan! As good as fast food can get!


Review 7: I call it "The Fast Lane".  The kids who work the drive thru here always get it right, are incredibly fast, and unfailingly courteous - without overdone spiels or orchestrated upsells. This is the best of the new (technology, efficiency) combined with the best of the old (steady, hardworking kids, unburdened by consultants  keen on turning them into obnoxious 'sales associates'.) ...  ... Understated, bedrock service.  Kudos to the mgr. Your guys and gals do a terrific job.


Review 8: Busy location. Clean and modern interior, same average staff as other locations.


Review 9: I love Bog Macs, but the doctor said that is the absolute worst thing to be eating... I went here last week and the guy was a prick at the window.  I used to love happy meals, it's always fun for kids OCCASIONALLY.  Anyway, descent place to go.


Review 10: Majority of the time this location is a grade 'A' location, EXCEPT the managers in the morning. Last night my hot carmel mocha was made incorrectly, can't even tell you what it was, but it was cold and disgusting. This has only happened once before and the manager on duty was good at giving the money back to me the next morning when I get off of work. Especially last night 06/21/22 around 915 PM who ever was the supervisor (sorry forgot your name) but you were an absolute sweetheart! You upfront said "My name is _____ and I'm the manager on duty and I take full responsibility"...something so simple like that and understanding without just quickly saying "Oh okay...well we can get you another one" you went over and beyond, but that one statement caught my ear the most! Thank you and keep up the great work sir. I came back to get the refund for the coffee and the "manager" on duty was so careless. I simply let her know "The manager from last night told me to bring back the coffee I ordered last night to get a refund since I was unable to drink this coffee since it was cold and nasty" Her simple response was a quick "Oh ok. Here." - not a "Oh, I'm sorry about that" or nothing. She simply did a promo for a coffee and walked away, whipped her nose with her hand, walked over towards the hash browns and coughed with her mouth wide open, but didn't cover her mouth. I find stuff like that incredibly discussing and if that McDonald's wasn't full of customer's eating I would've called her out on how disgusting she was, sucks for the people who ate from there today...don't be surprised if you get sick. After that nasty mess I stated "So what's going on? You entered another drink, I stated I need a refund"...and her response was "You want a free coffee and and refund" - excuse me? First off - the coffee wasn't free secondly if you were to listen the first time, I stated I was told by the manager from last night to come back for a refund, but instead of being disrespectful and have a slick mouth like her, as I'm so well at doing, simply told her "NO, I said a refund...I don't need a coffee anymore, I worked my shift last night". She's lucky she didn't have her name tag on, another violation to dress code, because I definitely would've put it in this review. ANYWAYS - besides my bad experience today, DURING THE AFTERNOON / EVENING this location is pretty good at doing the right thing, but the few times I've been here in the morning for anything as simple as a drink, to a combo, something is always wrong or someone always rolled off the wrong side of the bed


Review 11: I do love the quick service and delicious food.  McNuggets are my guilty pleasure.  Today, I went and ordered a large iced tea unsweetened at the drive thru.  Another bonus is the $1 drink.  However, the tea was not fresh.  It was gross and I threw it away.  Shame on you for not keeping fresh tea on hand on a hot day!

Review 0: I went to this restaurant, located in Scottsdale, thinking that it would be a big deal. Well, I hadn't seen the little "$" sign earlier and arrived there discovering that the raving is on point.  The fries were great. The burgers churned out by the dozen with amazing consistency.  I guess the owners name is Ronald and he's an odd looking fellow...maybe European as he looked a little eccentric to be American.  I'll definitely be back and hope to meet the owner and chef.


Review 1: I'm a social worker who visits homes in central Phoenix and this is my go to McDonald's when I need a cheap coffee or if I need to use the bathroom. This is the cleanest/safest McDonald's in the area and I never hesitate to stay here to do work if I'm feeling too cheap to hit up Starbucks. I've encountered the occasional weirdo, but I don't feel too bad when a non-weirdo is sitting on the other side of me. There are also TVs that usually play CNN or FOX (not sure). It's nice to hear the news while I'm sitting inside doing case notes! Highly recommend this location!


Review 2: Now this is one fancy treat! I went to this mcdonalds late saturday night and almost blew out my britches from the terrible burger king the night before when I realized how good the golden arche's prices treat ya! With the cost of gas more than your neighbors flapjack its hard to imagine how they cram all that chicken in each nuggy and keep it only a dollar to add on to ANY combo meal. 5 stars!


Review 3: Ok, I'm not gonna lie.  I feel a bit silly reviewing a McDonalds, but you have to give credit where it's due.  The five stars goes to the morning crew.  There have been many mornings where i have been hungry on the way to work, so i succumb to the temptation of the golden arches. ... I used to be intimidated if there are four or five cars in line.  Not at this place.  And not only are they SUPER fast, it's ALWAYS fresh and delicious.  I'll often pick up egg and cheese mcmuffins for some of my coworkers and we all agree.  They must have magic elves in the kitchen because these are the best mcmuffins e.v.e.r.   ... I also think they must have some sort of mind control device that causes your time to speed up while their time slows down, because on more than one occasion, I've barely had to stop my car because there they are, window open, beverage and bag in hand, smile and "have a nice day" on their lips.   ... The pm crew leaves a bit to to be desired, but the morning crew has me at hello.


Review 4: The staff is friendly and always make sure ur order is right. The food is done very fast and it taste great.


Review 5: This is by far one best McDonalds I've ever been to! ...  ... French Fries are always fresh & HOT, drive through is always fast, special orders are completed by the time I get to the final window, and the most important thing - my order is always correct when I get home or to the office. ...  ... Drive through is open 24 hours for those late night cravings. ...  ... They even have a charging station for your electric vehicle and a large indoor playground for the kids.


Review 6: Occasionally I just feel like going out for just basic breakfast, i come to this particular MacDonald's.  It's a place to have a big breakfast and watch some of the interesting people that you now are regulars among others. It's always clean and the service pretty quick. it's by no means and exciting venue!   is okay for what it is.  I am not a big breakfast eater so it serves the purpose when I am in that particular mood. ...  ... When I am traveling I often go to a MacDonald's for breakfast.  I usually need to eat something and can count on pretty standard fare and a decent price.  If it's just before catching a plane in the morning, a Greek meal that I might prefer first thing in the morning might not set well at takeoff as a big breakfast..


Review 7: I come here when my fiance who is pregnant craves french fries after having extreme food aversion to anything we try to eat at home. Usually it is pretty quick even though there are lines in the drive-thru as usual. ...  ... I decided to Yelp this place today though because it is either extreme coincidence or racism that occurs each time I go. I honestly don't care either way, but I think it is interesting to report.. ...  ... I am a Caucasian adult male, and I commonly have African American adult males ringing me up or handing me the GIANT bag for the one order of french fries. Every single time so far they avoid looking at me, don't ask me if I need anything or any questions, and beyond that they literally do not say a WORD. Even when I say 'thank you' before I leave it is ignored. ...  ... Today though, which is also why I wanted to write a review, FOR THE FIRST TIME, I was asked if I wanted ketchup, and my fiance didn't want any, but I was glad that someone thought about how they never give you anything, not even salt, on the side, and wanted to make sure the order was okay. The funniest joke about this was that he was an older Caucasian adult male. He even responded when I said 'thank you'. That is what made the difference of treatment stand out to me. I always assume fast food workers won't say a word, but this particular experience painted a weird picture over the different visits. ...  ... I wish I would have asked his name. I think people deserve credit for doing things like that, it is exhausting to have to keep that energy with every customer all day.


Review 8: It is so unhealthy and gross! the chicken there isn't even real. YUCK!!!


Review 9: Slow. Wrong order and didn't ask if i wanted cream and sugar. Saw one guy walking around aimlessly looking at the register. Wont be coming back.


Review 10: This McDonalds is terrible  ... They want to nickel and dime u for everything now they are even trying to charge for expresso in  their Ice Mochas which should come with a set amount as they always did  ... Management sucks they always screw up at this location  ... We will not return which is unfortunate because its right around the corner from where we work and are regular customers


Review 11: Worst McD's in the world wide Franchise!!! I live down the road and they consistently serve old, soggy fries!  The workers consistently sound irritable and commonly get your order wrong.  I usually would not waste my time reviewing a McD's but after 10+ visits to this McD's I am thoroughly dissatisfied.  Do your self a favor and drive down the road to the next McD.  Especially if you want hot, fresh, crispy McDonald's Fries!

Review 0: You forget how lucky you are until you try other places.  ...  ... This MCD went through a Renovation a couple years ago and still looks brand new inside. They have the coolest decor, it is all Americana.  ...  ... The service is usually quick and I cannot recall a recent time where something was screwed up. Seriously That deserves 5 stars now-a days.  ...  ... No play land... yeah!  ... Double drive through ... Yeah!  ... Coffee thing with all the special stuff.... Yeah!  ...  ... oh and the occasional crack head... viewing pleasure i guess.


Review 1: This is the McDonald's inside Wal-Mart. Yes, there is also a McDonald's at 1851 W Bell Road (SE Corner of 19th ave and Bell. ... They offer free wifi, whereas the other does not. The wifi works almost throughout Wal-Mart.  ... I usually only get a drink. One gluttonous night, I did try to get a pie, but since it was late, they were out. :( By late I mean between 10-11pm. ... Otherwise though, it's really convenient especially if you have kids that you had to take with to the store and they're hungry, or you just want some Mickey D's yourself. ... I'm not a huge fan of McDonald's in general, but there is nothing atrocious about this location.


Review 2: **Be sure to check your order before you leave this McDonald's. It's always missing some food item.** ...  ... This has happened to me 6 different times over the past 4 months. Why didn't I learn my lesson after the first time? It's not something you normally think about when you're in the drive thru, that "Oh yeah this is the one that ALWAYS leaves something out!" Plus, I've had other family members go get my order and forgot to warn them. It won't happen again because I'll never go back or send anyone else there. ...  ... When I call the manager , he's always apologetic and says he'll replace the missing item but that's always a big inconvenience. Who wants to drive all the way back? ...  ... The only reason I gave it two stars is because it's the only McDonald's up in North Phoenix that has the game pieces throughout the entire Monopoly Game season. Other McDonald's run out the first few days or the first week. I guess this is the only McDonald's that doesn't let employees pilfer the pieces.


Review 3: This is the worst McDonald's ever!!! Customer Service is horrible. My boyfriend and I ordered a caramel sundae and the guy forgot to ring it up, he didn't give is us our receipt so we didn't know!! The lady at the window got mad when we asked for a copy of our receipt and was like fuck then slammed the window. So the guy who took our order named Miguel came and was like uhm I'mma need $2.17 super rude! First off the sundae's are $1 we only wanted a copy of the receipt bc there was a long line behind us. Then he was like fuck you guys get the fuck out of here. My bf was so pissed off but I told him to just go. So he drives stick and had to change his gear so the MANAGER on duty comes and was like bitch don't ever come back here we will refuse your service fuck you, get the fuck off the lot. My boyfriend of course yelled fuck you as we pulled off and this stupid unprofessional moron screamed fuck you cunts while flipping us off!!! All bc we wanted a copy of our receipt because the dumb ass didn't give it to us!!! This McD will NEVER get another penny from me or any of my friends!!!! Rudest people and service in my life!!! I only had to give 1 star to post

Review 0: It's McDonald's.  What do you really expect. I work nearby so it's convenient when I run out of leftovers to bring for lunch. They never messed up my order and it seems well organized. The only time I really had a bit of a wait in the drive-thru was when the person in front of me paid entirely with change. And that's not McDonald's fault.  I only gave 4 stars because let's face it, it's gross fast food. It'll get you by in a jam, but eating here on the regular is not something I can recommend.


Review 1: Stopped in the drive through after DBacks Fan Fest to grab a light bite and a drink on the way home. Got a Buffalo Spicy McChicken Sandwich and a large Coke Zero from the Dollar Menu and got in and out rather fast.  ...  ... Newly remodeled, this location looks much better than it did before. The ONLY drawback I had was trying to get back out onto the street to catch the freeway, as traffic from Fan Fest was impossible, but someone was kind enough to let me out. That was cool by me.


Review 2: This perennialy 1-2 Star neighborhood McDonald's recently underwent a complete remodeling, so I stopped in for lunch today to see if they're doing better.  It's nice inside with lots of booths (Yay booths!), and has a completely different floor plan than before. ...  ... I went with a Quarter Pounder Habaero Bacon Ranch Cheeseburger, medium Fries & a small Chocolate Shake ($7.78).  Everything was right with both the food & the restaurant this time & it was excellent for the money.     :-)) ...  ... Now about those 610+380+570=1460 calories!     :-O


Review 3: Well, it's been 8 months since I gave this McDonalds a try & they got 1 Star, partly for the blowers only in the bathroom, with no paper towels & even no ass gaskets to dry your hands on & pull the door open with to get out. ...  ... Today, the above situation is still the same, & although there is a button to push for handicapped people that is supposed to open the door, it is still broken too! ...  ... The dining room was clean & comfortable, & I ordered an Angus Bacon & Cheese Burger Combo, upgrading the drink to a medium chocolate shake.  The burger was quite good after I added some ketchup to moisten it up.  The fries tasted as if they had been sitting out for a long time, & the shake was rather runny & only ok in taste. ...  ... #13 Angus Bacon & Cheese Combo w/medium shake $7.49 ...  ... This place is no Smashburger!!


Review 4: Here's how it is at this Mc Donald's: ...  ... You want to wash your hands before you eat, so you go in the rest room & do so.  Then, there is no paper towel dispenser, only those blowers, so you push the button with your elbow & then wipe your hands on your clothes when it stops.  Never mind that, you say, I'll dry my hands with a handful of ass gaskets...  Nope.  They don't have those in public bathrooms in Arizona!  (ALL public restaurants in other states have them!)  Now the door only opens IN to get out of the rest room, & it certainly has more germs on the handle than your hands had when you came in, so now what?  No problem.  There's a button for the handicapped to push to make the door open, so you push IT with your germy elbow that you used to start the blower.  Woe, nothing happens, because the button doesn't work.  Fine, you get some toilet paper to open the door with.  Nope.  It's run out.  Fine, you decide to use the side of your left hand & try not to forget & let it come in contact with anything while you're eating.  Then when you get home, after washing your hands & your elbow, you use both hands to raise hell right here about this piece-of-crap Mc Donald's.    :-O ...  ... We deserve better than this, even at Mc Donalds!


Review 5: old hard fries. stale bread on cheesburgers.  will never be back to this location.


Review 6: Stopped by the drive through to get lunch for me and the hubby.  ...  ... First off, the girl on the speaker was super hard to understand. Not because of the speaker, but because of her accent. If you're going to put someone on drive through orders, make sure the people in line can decipher what they're saying. ...  ... Second, this place has two drive through lanes. Everyone knows it's supposed to go one lane at a time for ordering. The lane next to me had three cars go through before my order even got taken.  ...  ... Third, my order got punched in wrong. When I got to the window to pay, the girl read off my order AS SHE SWIPED MY CARD. So basically I'm stuck with whatever they want to give me at that point. I ordered a nugget combo meal and a chicken club combo meal. When I told the girl the sandwich was wrong (they had a quarter pounder on there), she called back to someone to have it corrected and told me they would give it to me at the next window. ...  ... I get to the window and the guy there is basically throwing my food and drinks at me. I asked him if there was a chicken sandwich in the bag and he said yes. Lesson learned - always check the bag. I open it up and find a quarter pounder with bacon - no cheese. Definitely NOT what I ordered. Not to mention that each of my drinks had three (yes, three) cups attached to each other. Maybe if the guy hadn't been throwing my food at me he would have taken the time to only give me one cup. That ought to throw their drink count off tonight. ...  ... Will not be back.

Review 0: As far as a McDonald's this close to a Wal-Mart goes. I was actually kind of impressed with how well kept it was. Comparatively speaking... ...  ... I had some time to kill before an appointment so I sat down with my laptop and had a coffee. There were tables with power outlets available specifically for customer use and the free wifi was nice. ...  ... This is McDonald's we're talking about here. They get 4 stars because my expectations were very low and they actually managed to impress me quite a bit during my short visit.


Review 1: I goto McD's twice a year. Shamrock shake and McRib. This year I added a 3rd trip during the BOGO offer for the new Quarter Pounders. ...  ... Drive thru here offers two lanes to order that converge into one for pickup. Drivers beware. Many drivers leaving the DriveThru also U-turn into the parking area on the East side, so it's probably not a great place to park - and you take your life into your hands if you are trying to leave the Wal-mart via that passageway. ...  ... We found the new habanero QP to be fairly tasty, with a giant slice of tomato and the sauce was actually decent, with some spice to it. Not hot, but hotter than I expected from McD. I was gonna give them 3 stars for the fact that I was pleasantly sursprised. ...  ... Then, I remembered that my previous trip here they didn't have shamrock shakes. They were out. Like 3 days into the limited time promotion. Back to two stars.


Review 2: Mcdonalds is obviously the most generic hamburger place. It is also the most succesfull despite being one of the worst. Outside of the beloved french fries, what does good ole Mcds have going for it? Carls Jr beat their $1 drink with one for 69 cents. The new wings are horrible. Yes they are bigger then the kind you get elsewhere, but not the right kind of spicy and too expensive. The "special sauce" always brings down the burgers which arent that good to begin with. Now that Mcdonalds is planning on eliminating the dollar menu and replacing it with a $5 menu, maybe its time to try the Sonic up the street.


Review 3: This is the McDonald's on the corner of 19th ave and Bell Rd.  ... Even remodeled, it still looks dirty. It has always looked dirty in the 10 years I have driven past it and occasionally gone inside. There are always some sketchy looking characters loitering around too. ...  It's right next to and across from some of the busiest bus stops in town, so it does have the convenience factor. ... The last time I got a Big Mac and fries, it was not fresh. ... I never thought I would say this, but if you want a better McDonald's, just go into Wal-Mart right behind and try their McDonald's.

Review 0: i love this place. everytime i come here the workers are so nice and they always do as i ask them to and not mess anything up and if they do they correct it with no problem. the guy in the driver thru window always has a smile and is very polite. they make me happy each time. if you need a quick meal stop in and see them today


Review 1: Okay, I know it's just McDonald's, but I feel this particular location deserves a good review.  ...  ... After moving away from this McDonalds, I realized just how great the service is here. The staff is friendly (all the time) and fast! No waiting at this McDonalds. By the time you pay in the drive-thru, move up to the second window, your food is waiting; fresh and hot! ...  ... The food is just what you would expect from McDonalds. So I'm not going to waste my time critiquing  it.


Review 2: Hey, I was impressed with "This" McDonalds!! My younger kids like to go here to play! I am NOT a fan of most McDonald franchizes as they have young people working there that are Rude & Lazy and they are NOT clean! ...  ... BUT, This place was Clean! The lady that greeted us when we walked in was very sweet! ... They were out of TP in the bathroom and just put the roll on top of the Handycapped Bar :-(      NOT a fan of that! Then when my daughter went to the bathroom it kept falling on the floor and rolling around the floor, YUCK!!!  NASTY! ...  ... Other than that I would say they did good! But please teach your employees to put the toilet paper "IN" the proper container so we don't get everybody elses germies!!


Review 3: I know it is a McDonald's. I get it. But as far as a fast food chain goes, this particualr McDonald's has my loyalty.  ...  ... Talk about your fast friendly service. Whether I am ordering just coffee or a couple hash browns for my boy and I on the way into school I know I will be through the drive-thru in 5 minutes tops!


Review 4: This McDonald's is a nice, fast one. They have the double drive-through lanes to order from, and then the lane turns in to one as you head to the pick-up window. The people there were friendly and efficient.  ...  ... Quick service, and I was on my way in less than 10 minutes, after being in a line of at least 5 cars ahead of me. Now that's what I call lightning fast!


Review 5: this mcdonald's is always providing quick customer service. staff is friendly. drive-thru has double lanes which also makes it quicker. other than that to be honest i don't like mcdonald's. im simply reviewing the service. which i think is fast and friendly. im not a fan of the food. my kid wanted chicken nuggets.


Review 6: Appears to have been recently renovated inside. Everything else is what you would expect at an average McDonald's chain location.


Review 7: Ok, so I've been eating at McDonald's recently.  I swore them off a few years ago when they changed what they cooked their food in, and it was making my stomach churn.  But, as of late, sometimes I need something quick and I swing in here to curb my hunger from time to time. ...  ... Overall, the place is good.  Two drive thru lines, clean location, food is predictable and it still makes my stomach churn.  But, I must say, this place has quite the variety of clientle. ...  ... For example, one time I was reading Dave Mustaine's autobiography.  The young girl behind the counter asked who it was. I started to explain that he formed Megadeth after getting kicked out of Metallica back in the day.  Her eye's glazed over and she had no clue who or what I was referring too.  Does this make me old? No. It just was sad that people don't know this stuff.  *sigh* ...  ... Another time there was a fundraiser for the Middle school I live close to and the teachers were raising money by running the registers.  That was pretty cool.  Other times its quiet in here and there's nothing going on. ...  ... Tonight I went with the Southern Chicken sandwich, and it was tasty.  I also was getting checked out by a sort of cute gangbanger while I ate who had tattoos on his head.  On the way out a lady was punching and kicking a road construction cone on the way into the parking lot. She must have walked from across the street.  Poor cone... ...  ... Anyways, place isn't half bad and I think I'm done eating Micky D's for a while...


Review 8: Dropped to a one star review for shitty business practices and hiring shady bastards at the register.


Review 9: Went to order chicken nuggets through the drive through. Found out McDonald's discontinued my favorite spicy/hot mustard sauce. I left without ordering anything... Won't be back. DISAPPOINTED!!

Review 0: I don't know if it's a good thing or a bad thing that I know this, but if you frequent this McDonald's enough, the staff actually takes the time to call you by name...pretty cool.


Review 1: I give this McDonald's 5 stars because of how fast and effecient they are. I often come here before work for coffee or a McMuffin and the line can get quite long, but it has never taken longer than few minutes to get through the drive thru. Perhaps it is because they utilize both drive thru windows. Doesn't it seem like most fast food places make you go straight to the second window, making it less efficient?


Review 2: It is a McDonalds.  ... Food was fresh and exactly what I ordered.


Review 3: Food was literally fast here, and truly fast unlike most fast food places these days.  Huge playground is nice as well.  Never thought I'd be praising a McDonald's attached to a gas station!


Review 4: Gotta give it to this McDonalds.  Their drive through line can get pretty long but the service is always fast.


Review 5: I enjoyed my visit here. Very friendly staff and pretty clean too. The food was good and you really can't complain about it.


Review 6: Ok, I know it's McDonald's and my expectations aren't really that high, but there are 2 things about this McDonald's that really irritate me.   ... 1.  When I order a burger without onions, I expect it to show up without onions.  This doesn't really happen at this McD's. ... 2.  When your dollar menu has an item on it named "sausage mcmuffin" and I order a sausage mcmuffin, I don't want to be asked EVERY time if I want a sausage mcmuffin with egg.  If I had wanted a sausage mcmuffin with egg I would have asked for a sausage mcmuffin with egg, since that is what it is called on your menu!  WHY do you have to ask EVERY time if I want the mcmuffin with egg?  I just don't understand. ...  ... Despite these two very irksome things, the staff overall is above average for a McDonald's.  The regular crew who work there in the morning are always friendly and pleasant (despite the fact that they keep asking me about eggs).  The people are the only reason I still go there.


Review 7: I really don't like giving such low stars on Yelp, but I also want to give honest feedback to businesses so that they're able to change the less than desireable behavior AND warn my other fellow Yelpers. I've been through the drive-thru at this location 2x now. First time was less than favorable, but I wanted to give them 1 more chance to shine...  ...  ... On Sunday, 1/27/12 at approx 10am, that didn't happen unfortunately. ...  ... Okay, it all starts w/the interaction at the speaker when one orders their goodies, right? Well, even if you can't see the person's face, it is still crucial to be polite/helpful with the customer. Please don't be sarcastic/snarky to me if I ask a simple question about hours of breakfast. ...  ... Second point of interaction - at first window. I was digging for exact change in my purse, but is that any reason to yell at your coworker in the back, "I'm waiting on her - jeez, chill out!" and then to roll your eyes and say to me (customer) "it's like we're an old married couple". Very unprofessional. ...  ... Third point of interaction - delivery of food/drink. This went okay, but I ordered a vanilla iced coffee. What I rec'd was vanilla-flavored milk sans any coffee. Not cool. ...  ... Had to park my car, go inside and explain situation to cashier. Maybe I was extra annoyed because I was a tad hungover and really needed that caffeine boost? Plus, I wasn't showered and in sweats, etc - I really had NO business being in public which is why I did the drive-thru option in the first place!! The Manager seemed surprised at my story and almost didn't "believe me". Really dude? I don't have better things to do than invent and concoct this story?? ...  ... After his thorough examination of the coffee-less beverage, he personally made me a new one. He then gave a nice apology. Perfect - that's all I needed... ...  ... Moral of the story? Just get it right the first time, okay??


Review 8: Well, it is a McDonald's attached to a gas station so what can you expect.   ...  ... First thing that irritated me with this place... the drive thru.  Sometimes, it is inconveniently closed during peak morning hours.  Why? I don't know.  I'm assuming they are understaffed. ...  ... Second, the bathroom is disgusting and unisex.  I won't let my poor daughter use it even if she is about to pop.


Review 9: Go to this McDonald's locations drive-thru and order 3 things.... chocolate shake, vanilla cone but in a cup - for my boys and fries.  When I got to the window to get my food nothing was ready... you mean with 3 people in the restaurant your staff can't get this ready? Then I look up and realize there is one person already pulled over waiting for what they ordered which ended up being one of their iced coffees. Manager finally comes out with my shake and the boys ice cream, forgets the fries and a straw.  You are a manager? Really? Are you that out of touch? Did you just bring me a shake and no straw and totally forget my fries.  I guess you just can't fix stupid.  I will NEVER go to this location again. Reading the other reviews this store seems to have an evil twin, one really good at what they do the other they just can't get their crap together.


Review 10: Horrible drive-thru. ALWAYS gets something in the order wrong.


Review 11: This is one of the worst McD's I've been to (unfortunately closest to my house) and it seems like the reason why is management. In the 5 years I've been going here, I've had many incorrect orders, been overcharged several times, had inconsistent or poorly made food/coffee, been treated rudely when trying to get problems corrected. I've had to wait FOREVER because of understaffing (or maybe they're just that bad). A couple times they asked me to pull ahead at the drive-thru and wait for them to bring my food out to me. Both times it was clear that I had been forgotten, I didn't order much at all and watched for 10+ minutes while people behind me drove off with their food and drink. I actually had to call and remind them I was still waiting! The icing on the cake is I just found out they raised the price of the McWrap from $3.99 to $4.99, the only McD's in the area that has done this. So you know what? I'm done with this location. If I absolutely had to have McD's again, it'll be somewhere else. Whoever owns this franchise needs to get a clue. ...  ... One last tip to this location... Try putting an adequate amount of sauce/mayo on stuff so people don't have to order it with extra, which sometimes backfires when you actually get "extra" (better than not enough IMO, but still way too much). Seriously, you want me to come back behind the counter and teach everyone what a "normal" amount of sauce looks like? It's not hard people...


Review 12: This place was ridiculously slow tonight. I stopped for my yearly crave - the Shamrock Shake. To be honest, I have no idea why I love these, especially since I like REAL ice cream and shakes the old fashion way - but this minty green shakes have me hooked. My son also wanted one, but he wasn't quite sure he would like it so I asked if he could have a small taste of mine before they made his; however, they could not do that. Instead I had to buy my shake, move to the side while the order was rung through the POS and then filled and brought out to me. Once he decided if he liked it or wanted another flavor, we had to place another order and then pay for it.  I asked if I could just pay for a small shake and he would decide the flavor after he tasted my - NOPE. I was highly annoyed. I understand restaurant POS and the need to track inventory, but come on - it's a shake. Not only that ... it took over 10 minutes for 2 shakes and they weren't that busy.  ...  ... Unfortunately, I have been to this location on several times because it is close to the house. I typically don't eat the food, but my son loves McDonalds, so I stop for him. On numerous occasions they have messed up the order (he only eats plain burgers) and the service speed is extremely random, regardless of how busy they are. Sometimes it is awesome, other times it is horribly slow.  ...  ... I really don't like giving businesses a poor rating, but this last visit topped it off, and I had to share. I understand the machines are automated, but they could have rang up the shakes and then manually poored the correct flavor, it isn't rocket science, and it isn't going to through off their inventory!


Review 13: We were served breakfast at 7 am on July 1st. When we got our orange juices one was noticeably a lighter color and only filled 3/4 of the way. The girl had an attitude (breanna) when we asked to have it swapped out. We also were given a sandwich with cheese when specifically asked for no cheese. When they brought the sandwich back out it was still wrong.


Review 14: Why oh WHY did I even come back here last Saturday night? Well, self, because you quite frankly had major munchies and needed salty food bc of your vodka consumption. That's why. ...  ... I do, however, regret consuming food at this McD's location - even in my drunken haze. ...  ... My Filet-O-Fish (towards the end) had a long (about 3") white hair in the tartar sauce. I started gagging and spit out the burger and the rest. ...  ... Never again. Never!!!!

Review 0: Okay, so I guess it's just the night crew or something, but I came on Sunday mid morning  for a quick meal and they were awesome! Much better than last time.


Review 1: Updating my review after several weeks. Appears maybe the managers read these reviews. In the last few weeks this store has improved 2 stars. The eggs in my BBs have been cooked perfectly, Diet Coke tastes better and they have not forgotten anything in all my visits. Added two stars because they have been consistently 5 stars since my last review...but I am still watching.


Review 2: Big breakfast with hotcakes pretty much a staple for my breakfast when I start work early. It is always hit or miss at this location. No consistency in who is cooking the eggs. Sometimes way over cooked, sometimes just right. I worked at McD's for 2 1/2 years when I was in high school. I learned how to cook eggs properly, so can they. ... Another note, they always seem to forget something in the drive-thru. Utensils, jelly, napkins, syrup...it is ALWAYS something.  ... Another Yelper mentioned the funky tasting Diet Dr. Pepper. I agree.Diet Coke taste funny too.


Review 3: I basically order an egg biscuit sandwich and a diet Dr. Pepper when I don't have time to prepare breakfast at home. The food tastes great but unless you're in the drive thru you can expect a longer wait. I don't go thru the drive thru because I just spent $73 on gas this morning and I don't need to burn any extra gas while waiting in line. Plus, sometimes the diet Dr. Pepper tastes a little funky unless you let the soda that's been sitting in "the tubes" OVERNIGHT run for awhile before putting your cup under the dispenser. And as of today, I guess they don't give napkins with your to go order when you order inside. ...  ... I suggest this McDonald's gets a little bit more wo(man) power during the morning rush to service the customers in a more timely manner.


Review 4: Coming to this McDonald's is like a box of chocolates, cause you never know what a your going to get. A smorgasbord of different experiences.  ...  ... Parked for an iced coffee the last visit and then when it came it tasted like they gave up waiting for fresh coffee and brought me what they had left over from the night before...bitter. Two sips and out the window it went (I kept the cup, I did not litter). Seriously...parked for an iced coffee???  Plus they give me my HOT food to wait for a cold drink.  ...  ... Without writing a book, my experience dictates that this location should only be visited during rush hours. The staff seems to lack the mental capacity to understand anything about quality, communication or consistency.  ...  ... Management, I highly recommend you re-train your staff on actual McDonald's corporate procedures and learn the guidelines on what is considered fresh...and how to read a clock.


Review 5: My first two visits to this place was not good.  (Backround: My first job was working in a McDonald's restaurant in another state, so i know how a good burger should taste like) ...  ...  ...  First week: i order a BLT Crispy chicken sandwich at the driver thru.    I get to the window and the cashier had me pull up to the waiting area due to the fact that it takes a 5 minutes to fry the chicken piece.  So i wait for almost 13 minutes.  I then park my vehicle and i was about to walk in and get my money back when my food finally arrives.   ...    When i get to my work site, i eat my sandwich and the chicken is WAY overcooked.  I called their complaint dept. number listed on the receipt. ...  ...  2nd week: i order a Bacon& cheese Snack wrap. Instead i get the deluxe snack wrap.    ...  ... I called their complaint line twice and i got no response to my complaints.  ...  ...  ... Sometime soon i will try to order from this location again and see if they corrected their flaws ...  ...  This all took place 5 months ago so maybe they have a new manager now that actually knows how to run a restaurant.


Review 6: Not the best McD's in town. Almost every time I go here, something doesn't go right.  Whether it's a frapp that isn't thoroughly blended (ice chunks in it), or slow service, or someone very incoherent on the drive thru speaker, it seems to always be lacking in consistency and good service as a norm.


Review 7: Holy cow, worst customer service ever. We ordered two premium wraps through the drive through. Took about 20 mins and we were the only people there. We could here the employees screaming at each other whole making our order. Won't come here again!


Review 8: I just had to... I'm writing this post mortem (BTW) ...  ... Running late to a Saturday soccer match.  Needed some "fast food."  Although I've seen "Super Size Me," we were in unfamiliar territory.  Typically for me, anything west of 7th street is considered east California.  Guilty, I don't know my way "round the west side." ...  ... This is why I don't like Mc Donalds. ...  ... Ordered the Big Breakfast (plate of shit). ...  ... "Light fluffy scrambled eggs, savory sausage, a flaky buttermilk biscuit, crispy hash browns and three golden brown hotcakes. Could it get any better?" per mc donald's web site.   ...  ... golly f-ing geez, put and adjective in front of anything, and i'll eat it: : savory, flaky, crispy, golden diarrhea dog turd.  Y.U.M.M.Y. ...  ... I got a square egg patty.  swear to jesus.  square (think it was to go to an egg mc muffin) ...  ... pancakes.  and biscuit yummy. ...  ... sausage. greasy.  seriously? okay, i knew it would be greasy. ...  ... had to ask for my hash brown (was forgotten), so the nice lady gave me two.  and then i had a heart attack.  unfortunately, no one working there was smart enough to call 911, so i died. ...  ... lo siento, pero no mexicans working there AT all, so service was SLOW.  Every senior citizen, bless their little old hearts, was in line in front of me.  and.  I SWEAR TO GOD the cashier had to get her phone out to add. ...  ... So I ate my last meal, took a Lipitor, but it was too late.  I died.  No one called 911, since the staff can't read nor add, and the elderly didn't have cell phones.


Review 9: This is one of the worst McD's around. They are slow service, back up easily, half the time screw up the order and some crew members are pretty rude (considering what their job is to serve). Not to mention they have the open late sign but constantly shut down early at night. Forget the late night ice cream run... Wawawahhhh!

Review 0: Mm M MMMMMM!!! A 24-hour drive thru serving up my fast food favorites!!! It is conveniently located, and despite the questionable hygiene of the crowd that streams through here, this restaurant is very clean. Another plus is that they have a double drive-thru and extremely efficient and polite employees to go along with it. I never have to wait for my food very long at all!


Review 1: Fourth place I have tried to eat at third mcdonalds first three places were closed down


Review 2: This is the only place open near work at 3am. The service was good but had to wait for hot coffee which was a bit annoying.


Review 3: Hey.  It's McDonalds.  What can I say?  Kind of a seedy crowd hanging out at 8AM but it is what it is.  I got a bit tired of paying $30 to have two eggs and etc. brought up to my room in the Sheraton on 3rd St. so I cut loose one morning, got in the Avis car, and drove down to Third Ave. and had two Egg McMuffins for $5.  Nothing satisfies like an EggMc.  I will admit, my coffee was from Starbucks.  They totally hit the spot.


Review 4: It's a Mickey D's... what can you say? As far as McDonald's goes, this one is A-Ok! The people watching is priceless, the food is the best hangover cure (or late night drunk snack), and for the amount of shit the employees have to put up with from the local cracked out transients, they somehow manage to smile when taking your order! Keep up the good work!


Review 5: So I have mixed feeling for this MIcky Ds .. I live downt he street so I go here often if its for a soda ice cream or a regular burger.. I got diffrent times late nights early mornings.. But theres seems to be an inconsistent employee One of the drive thru girls During the night and midnight shift is very nice helpful and talkative Fast! Nows me as a regular now. But on occasions shes not there and I have the worst experince employee who argue with me about only the fires come large but not the drink in my meal?? With a Cigarette on her ear? Really? 1/3 time my order is wrong... If i were manager I would clean out some employees... But at teh same time its just Mcdonalds..


Review 6: I don't often review McD, but after my experience with their drive-thru, I needed to say something.  I went here during afternoon rush hour on the way home from work.  Not only did I get a regular Dr. Pepper instead of the Diet Coke I ordered, but I realized why the drive thru was going so slow:  The exit line spills out onto southbound 7th Street as it crosses Van Buren.  During rush hour, this is a disaster.  So much traffic comes down 7th Street that you could find yourself waiting to exit the lot for five minutes or more--per car.  It might not take that much time for you, but it's the luck of the draw. ...  ... This is a more or less typical McD, situated in a lousy spot traffic-wise.  I'm not lovin' it.  Even if you get what you order, you'll have to wait forever to get it.  Nothing's fast about the food around 4:30 or 5:00pm if you're hoping to eat on the road.  Better to park, eat inside, and wait for the torrent of cars to die down a bit before heading home.


Review 7: Normally I wouldn't review a place like McDonald's since we all know that the food is fried, greasy, and all around bad for you. However, this McDonald's warrants a review because it is a people watching mecca. If you work anywhere in the area, go once...you will thank me. ...  ... You know you are going to a klassy McDonald's establishment when the first thing you see is a sign on the door that says "No large bags and no bedrolls". My co-workers and I have seen such interesting people as a guy with a gun in his waistband eating with his family; a woman in a bikini top talking to herself; and most recently on Saturday night, my co-worker and I saw a guy just released from county jail trying to get a "refill" of soda with a Circle K cup. This location is also quite the popular day laborer pickup spot. ...  ... Service isn't the best, but where is it outstanding when it comes to fast food? My co-workers and I have been to this McDonald's about four times in two years, but it always delivers on seeing "interesting" people. And for that reason, this McDonald's gets two stars.


Review 8: This McD's service sucks. I have been here numerous times and have had some sort of bad service every single time.


Review 9: This McDonalds has been here forever, at the corner of 7th Ave/Van Buren/Grand Ave. I stopped in for lunch today while walking home from an appointment. I figured... I haven't eaten Mickey D's in ages, why not? Plus, I'm walking, and it's a... scenic area. ...  ... I was impressed by the cleanliness, especially given the sad state of most of the customers and employees. I think it's mecca for tattooed gangbangers. ...  ... 2 stars instead of 1 because they have Diet Dr Pepper on tap. Oh yeah. ...  ... I had a double quarter pounder with cheese and fries. The fries were luke warm. The burger tasted institutional - think public school cafeteria.  ...  ... I imagine it might be a really entertaining place to stop by on a weekend evening, what with the hookers and hoes hotels nearby with their $20-something rooms and whatnot.  ...  ... Next time I'm in the 'hoooooood and want fast food, I'm hitting Church's Chicken across the street.


Review 10: It's near where I work, but I don't think I'm coming back.  The cashier & assistant manager were rude to me.  They didn't have the new Frappe/Mocha machine so they couldn't take my Iced Frappe coupon.  They told me I could have a coffee.  I told them I don't like plain coffee.  I suggested a free McFlurry, but the assistant manager refused saying that the McFlurry was a seperate category.  I told them that I'm probably not coming back & that I came almost every week.  The assistant manager acted like she could care less, which irritated me more.  It's BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE.  Because she wasn't willing to give a free McFlurry, they are going to lose more than $100 of sales from me.  SO STUPID of them!

Review 0: Its a mcdonalds


Review 1: Never had any issues here. They are always up to speed.


Review 2: On my way home from visiting my father at the Hospital! Wife's at work,not in the mood to cook this late in the evening!!! I haven't had my yearly splurge of McRibs!!!! So I stopped off at this location, pretty big place! Walked in, because drive through was pretty busy. Only one person in front of me, it was time for me to order! I order the McRib Sandwich Combo, she asked me if I wanted it large! Well no, but thanks for asking! Then she offered me a second sandwich for only .99 cents!!! Wow, well yes! I love to have my yearly McRib sandwich, It's a great time! This half hour of eating this great icon of a sandwich was amazing! You get that stamped piece of pork, lathered in a authentic BBQ sauce and loaded up with pickles and onions, Yea baby!!!! It's only one time a year, and just once! After that I'm good for another year!! Going back to this location, it was quite nice. Very clean, bilingual, and great service!


Review 3: Their ice cream cones are the BOMB!!


Review 4: Good service , but warning if you plan on going thru the drive thur you might be in line for 20 mins plus...


Review 5: Only come here for the dollar menu food.  Lots of people asking for money outside at night time, don't really like that.


Review 6: the lines are always ALWAYS long.  I don't get it.


Review 7: Today (7/3/14) was my last and final visit to this McDonald's...I'll drive out of my way to the one on Camelback from now on. My last couple of visit has left me not wanting to return the customer service is horrible, you can barely hear the drive thru attendant, there are long lines and you constantly have to wait for your food. When you finally get your food...the order is wrong or the fries are limp and soggy. I've visited this place for Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner and the midnight snack...and the results are all the time for every 10 visit, I bet I've had 3 good experiences.

Review 0: I heard the burgers here were good, so I figured I'd check it out.  ...  ... After sitting at my table for well over twenty minutes without a word from my server, I decided to go up to the counter to see what was wrong. The girl at the counter was nice enough and offered to take my order immediately while I was standing there. I appreciated that, but the girl still seemed very rushed and my order was very transactional. ...  ... I ordered the cheeseburger and I was shocked by how small it was. I guess it tasted okay, but overall it was very average and lackluster with a plain bun and a slice of boring American cheese. I felt like I could have gotten a hamburger like this on any other street in any other town.  ...  ... In addition, not once did the girl come around to see if we needed a refill on our drinks. After waiting well over an hour for the girl to offer a dessert or cup of coffee, we just left. Good thing, as I heard the coffee they serve there is so hot that if you pour it all over your lap, you will actually get burned. ...  ... As for ambience, the one thing I did like was the large family portrait on the wall. I was definitely impressed by the fact that there seemed to be an elected official in the family, but then I read that his last name was not McDonald, but instead McCheese and I couldn't help but think that he was not even related and instead only added for fluff. Even more important than that (and please note that I am all for trying to rehabilitate convicts), but if you have a family member who has been through the prison system, please at least put them in some different clothes before you take a family photo. ...  ... I still gave McDonald's five stars because I think it's important to support small businesses, but Mr. McDonald had better clean up his act if he has any true aspirations of making it in this business.


Review 1: was in this location on 03/04/2013 and the staff did not seem friendly. I came in to eat, the girl who was running the counter was too busy messing with her phone. I ordered and waited for my food. When they called my number they did not even say thank you for coming in. Now I know this is McDonald's but I have been n my share of them and they always say hello. Came back the next morning after I got off work and went through the drive thru. They were happy and thanked me and even stated hope to see me again. I am not sure what is with the night staff verus the day. But I guess I will use drive thru in the morning.


Review 2: we rarely have McDonalds and made a big mistake by going to this McDonalds when we arrived in Phoenix late night 3/23/2013 .   The staff is rude, they messed up the order and the food was cold.  The order was packed with the fries sideways and falling out and the bread was hard and stale.  The food was so bad we wound up throwing most of it away.    The wanna-be gangsta working the window wasn't happy when we pointed out their mistake.   The owner of this McDonalds should find some people who care a bit about their job...  the 2 people their on 3/23 could care less!


Review 3: Worst  mcdonalds ever,  0 stars if that would be possible , I went today 10/8/2013 and asked for extra MnMs on my McFlurry and got literally only 5 MnMs on it , worst  service ever , how disrespectful , I hope they close down , i work hard for my money and i expect the best McFlurry every time , not 5 pieces of MnMs and vanilla ice cream , SMH FAM

Review 0: so i went through the drive-thru today, and upon ordering 3 burgers and two with just ketchup and cheese, the "Se hablo espanol" working the mic kept ringing them up as "ketchup/no mustard" and repeated it back like 3 times,  after saying she didn't know how to get the order right because they got a new system (NOT MY PROBLEM!) doesn't give them an excuse to mess up my order! anyway we also ordered a "caramel apple sundae" the muchacha even repeated it back as "caramel apple sundae" then rang it up as a "hot fudge sundae" (not what i ordered!) then upon getting to the window they hand me a hot fudge sundae, after telling them about it, they go and get a caramel apple sundae with maybe an inch of ice cream and light caramel drizzle. at other McDonald's i get about 2-3x as much!!! i guess i wont be going back to this one for a while (at least until the estupido learns the "new system")


Review 1: Usually this Mcdonald's is not too bad. However, the orders and wait time has gotten pretty bad lately. Tonight, I waited in line at the drive-thru for 10 minutes before I could order.  ... So, I order some apple pie's with my meal and I am told it will take 10 minutes to cook them. Okay, so I order two hot fudge sundaes and I get home and realize they have put some bitter chocolate sauce on the sundaes instead of hot fudge. This has happened before. If someone pays you for a product, why don't you provide it?  My opinion of this McDonald's location is has really taken a dive down.


Review 2: Don't take your "Gold Card" here it"s not accepted per mgr. We bought the card for $20 to support the kids from a local high school and this McDs refused  it.  The card gives you a free cone with any purchase.  The cone probably costs mcds 5 cents to make.  All other mcds that i've been to accepts it.

Review 0: I love this Express Mcdonald's ! ...  ... Mcdonald's has the best fast food breakfast and I can always enjoy me a Big Mac and fries.  I usually stop here about once a month for either meal mentioned above on my way to work. ...  ... Prices are a little lower.  Employees are always nice and friendly.  Efficient.


Review 1: This is an express Mickey D's with two drive throughs for quick access.   ...  ... I wasn't too thrilled that I received a Coke with an unsecured lid that spill in my lap during my first time through though.  Other than that, it is your typical experience at a McDonald's.


Review 2: McDonalds "Express". I waited about 9 minutes for the person in front of me to get their food. I'm not sure what they ordered but they only got one bag. When I pulled up, there was no apology for the wait. Just "hi, your total is 5.62" or whatever the change was. Food tasted fine, but service and wait times were subpar. I'll drive further for the McDonalds 1 mile in the other direction.

Review 0: 06/04/13 ...  ... It's McDonalds,not much to say. I just wanted to point out the cool interior.


Review 1: Generally I don't review fast food places unless the customer service is outstanding or severely lacking. Unfortunately this review falls in the latter category. First the positive. This location is easy to access from the street, has sufficient parking, and the interior was clean although I did not see what state the bathrooms were in. My food was ready quickly and the employee who was calling out order numbers was friendly and ensured I received everything I ordered. ...  ... As for the customer service, my order was taken by a clearly inexperienced manager who walked away from the register no less than 4 times after asking "What can I get for you?" but before I could get a word out. When I finally had her attention again, I ordered my meal and took my receipt and she walked away again before giving me a cup for my drink. I was not impressed with the owners choice in management. ...  ... This location does not have a play area aside from a couple electronic games on the wall. Despite the distracted manager, the food was not below par for what it is and there were no safety or health concerns so I think 3 stars is fair for this visit.


Review 2: I dropped into this small McDonald's for a bite today & enjoyed it enough that I thought it was a little bit special.  They have comfortable booths, & my friendly counter gal gave me an extra dressing for my salad without charging me for it (as some McDonald's do).  It was also thoughtful of her to offer me a water cup when she saw that I didn't order a drink.  I'll get her name next time. ...  ... I don't have the nerve to give a McDonald's 4 Stars, but it was nice & I'm very likely to return!     :-)


Review 3: I can't believe I'm reviewing a McDonald's - but it had to happen.  Not just because I'm a freaking fast food junkie so it was going to happen one of these days anyhow - but because of today's experience. ...  ... I've been to this one, well, let's just say more than several times.  The food is always.... uneventful.  It's not one of those specifically great or specifically bad ones.  It's just..... fine?  The only really good thing I got there once was their big breakfast.  It was only McDonald's good, but man it tasted good that day. ...  ... Anyhow, so I was grabbing a breakfast burrito (that stupid healthy yogurt was not going to calm the grumbling monster that was my tummy that morning).  For breakfast, I'll normally either get my item solo, or as the meal w/ OJ.  But I remembered seeing last week that in a blind taste test, the McDonald's coffee actually scored higher on a taste test than Starbucks.  So I figured I'd give it a shot.   ...  ... ACKKKKKKK!!!!!!!!  PLECCCHHHHH!!!  Ick!  Ug!  Gross!  Spit, spit, spit....   I wanted to wipe my tongue down w/ the wood tasting napkin to scrape it all off.   ...  ... They had thrown in some sugar and cream.  I'll normally do a cream and a sugar for one this sized.  I initially tried it black. I thought maybe it was better w/ the stuff added.  This was a SMALL cup, and I added both creamers and all 6 sugars they gave me and I could barely taste any sweetness.  It was like the black hole of coffee condiments.  What is totally sad - I ended up drinking about 1/2-3/4 the cup just trying it after adding each condiment.  I really wanted it to be better.  Kept waiting for that magic ingredient.  It didn't come.   ...  ... Nasty, nasty, nasty.  Mediocre fast food, fine.  But the extra 15 min drive to Starbucks suddenly looks much more reasonable.


Review 4: I have visited this location on many occasions and have been disappointed one too many times. I'd say that going through the drive-thru has caused me more misery than necessary. I'm sure they've gotten my order wrong a minimum of 75% of the time and today's order included pickle stacked on the top (meaning outside) of the sandwich. Also, while waiting at the drive-thru window one time I even had the employee chat me up a bit during a long wait for food. He had the nerve to complain that McDonald's required that he take a test and that he failed it. (Shocking!) Do yourself a favor and avoid this location at all costs.


Review 5: Normally I try to stay away from McDonalds because they are everywhere so they are where I go when there is nothing else.  I still end up eating there every year or so with travel.  This time though I was just tired and it was the closest place to eat. ...  ... I went through the drive through and got one of the chicken wraps with fries and a drink.  When I got my bag there was no ketchup!  They didn't even ask if I wanted any.  Despite no ketchup the french fries tasted better than the wrap thing I had. ...  ... I don't normally eat here so I can't comment if the blah taste of my food was typical or not, but it wasn't worth the calories.  Plus I was peeved to be without ketchup.


Review 6: The coke still has a funny taste. I was hoping after they remodeled that that would be fixed.


Review 7: Fast food must not be fast anymore...? ...  ... After a 15 minute drive through wait, I drove up, smiled and said hello. I received a curt glance and a price for my food.  ...  ... I said thank you when I received my food, and the chick turned around and walked away.   ...  ... Thanks for reminding me why I haven't gone to McDonald's in years.

Review 0: As far as a McDonald's goes, this place is always pretty quick and efficient! ...  ... I come here pretty often for coffee in the mornings.  The lady in the drive-thru knows me and is super friendly!  They are always fast! ...  ... I've only had a few instances where there's been a bit too much cream or something in my coffee where it had to be thrown out.  More often it's done perfectly! ...  ... And with the new remodel, it looks great!


Review 1: You know you love it. Where else can you smile for a dollar? Oh yea, the gentlemen's club. They are similar establishments. Great values.


Review 2: I adore this McDonald's. The employees rate a 5, especially the morning shift. The food is always hot, always what I ordered, and well put-together. It's still McDonald's food, but when the craving strikes, I'll order from here without hesitation. I can't say that about many fast-food locations.


Review 3: Traveling through Phoenix, we were just looking for a light, quick bite to eat. We pulled up to one of the twin ordering stations. I thought this was a neat concept until I witnessed the not-well-thought-out merging process. The line from the second station was a straight shot to the pick-up window and the line from the first station had to merge into that line. It was a microcosm of Phoenix freeways at a McDonalds, complete with traffic jams and crazy drivers. ...  ... The food: My McBurger was dry and tasteless; my wife's chicken McNuggets were petrified and they forgot the ranch dipping sauce, which made her realize that the sauce is the only thing that saves them.  ...  ... This location is convenient to the freeway, but next time we are passing through I think we'll just keep going.


Review 4: I hate two lane drive thru. Unfortunately I live in the area.  Three times now they go out of order and I get stuck waiting for someone to acknowledge my lane.  Once they took two orders at the other lane while I sat waiting.  Poor procedure inside.  Each time no apologies and no offer to compensate even when I asked today. Go elsewhere like In N Out across the street.


Review 5: The manager is rude, my order is never correct, it really isn't hard to leave ice out of a drink people, the machine does it for you if you ring it up correct! 2 out of 3 times my kids food is wrong. I now avoid this location!

Review 0: It's McDonalds.  Exactly what we expected.  Cheap food fast.  Done.


Review 1: I got food here twice.  I rarely eat fast food but have a soft spot for egg mcmuffins; they don't seem THAT bad for you and are filling.  The first time, the English muffin part of it was just about burnt to a crisp and inedible (leaving me hungry until lunch).  The second time, it was barely toasted and the cheese was cold (giving it a much much much less desirable flavor).  This mixed with kinda rude staff (for those I've dealt with) on both occasions and I'm not going to make the same mistake a third time.


Review 2: If I could give this location zero stars I would. I am surprised this place is not shut down by food inspectors or McDonalds corp offices.  This is a horrific McDonalds. The food is always bad, cold, cooked, or served wrong, despite the easy order. ( Ice in a drink. REALLY? Ya can't even get that right McDonalds staff worker? )  The equipment is always broken, place is dirty except the parking lot ( More on that in a minute)  the staff do not speak English but work positions where they need to, and never  get the order or change correct.  ...    I had complained several times about the staff member who goes out and waters the parking lot every day. McDonalds corporate offices ( not in the deserts of Az of course)  tell me it is policy to wash the parking lots fully every day. REALLY? Even when it is clean? Really? The whole parking lot in a huge strip mall McDonalds? REALLY? Even when you have 200 cars backed up at drive through? Is this the workers only job? He sits out there on the curb holding a hose. He does not clean the restaurant or the bathroom or help serve the million people backed up on line? Hey I want that job. ( insert sarcasm here) Hey MIKEYD"S you do know we live in the desert right? ...     I used to go here every morning on the way to work for my cafe fix but I stopped last week. I will never go back. Last week the man with the hose was outsIde smoking!( yes a cig, it was lit, and yes he did inhale!)  He was also just aiming the hose in the air letting the water squirt into the air. No, thank you for asking, there were no trees, flowers or plants nearby, just cement. Not a clue what he was doing. Just wasting water in the desert and smoking. SMOKING???????Did I mention he was smoking? EWHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH Oh BTW, did I mention he was smoking????? Smoking around food? Ok, technically there was no food in the parking lot but ya get my drift right? I say OMG! How gross are you McDonalds?

Review 0: Servers are friendly here and the fries are always fresh and crisp. ...  ... The best thing about this MCD's is Mimi, their 88 year old worker. She always remembers me and others and gives us a grandmotherly hug. I wish I had her spunk and energy. A hard worker and such a sweetheart!  ...  ... 5 stars to Mimi!


Review 1: 20 McNuggets for under $5. When I crave a McDonald's cheeseburger, only a McDonald's cheeseburger will do. A life long staple.


Review 2: I always drive thru. Usually I get an ice cream of some sort. The ice cream is great. ...  ... I can't say much for the food but the breakfast can be great. I like their cafe drinks.  ...  ... All in all I'm happy with this location.


Review 3: I haven't eaten food from McDonald's in years, but I've stopped by this Mickey D's location several times recently for their ice cream cones...  ...  ... $1.64 for two ice cream cones... you can't beat that!  And they are reduced-fat too! ...  ... For those that want something fancier, they also offer McFlurries (the McDonalds version of DQ Blizzards) with toppings such as oreo cookies, M&M's and Rolos, and sundaes with hot fudge, hot caramel, and strawberry.   ...  ... As their slogan goes, "I'm lovin' it!"


Review 4: This particular McDonald's is actually decent. The cashiers sometimes have a hard time understanding English but usually get my order correct. And I usually only wait an average of seven minutes for my order to be ready.


Review 5: don't get me wrong mcDonalds is good but at specific locations it varies this is one of them i ordered drive thru for me and my lil one and well we got food poisoning next day we at first said cant be McDonalds but that was one of the last things we ate the prior day i hate to type this but watch out for sure

Review 0: The 5 stars I give this place is not for their food, because we all know what McDonalds is.  I go here almost every morning for my iced coffee that I love and adore. ...  ... I give them 5 stars because Ive come to know the staff there and they just rock.   ...  ... Maritza, Kiara, Maria and BB are among the best there and make my mornings a great one.


Review 1: Running around I got the munchies and stopped in for a couple of egg McMuffins.  They tasted the same as they have since they were invented in Santa Barbara decades ago.  The staff was friendly and I got my sandwiches quickly.   ...  ... I thought I had reviewed this location several years ago when I was here for a UYE fundraiser for Julia T's school.


Review 2: Granted if you've seen one McDonalds you've pretty much seen 'em all. However when I tried to order a caramel coffee - it's like I was speaking another language. I even explained how to make it and they still got it wrong.  ...  ... They refunded my money and I got a Coke instead.

Review 0: Finally! Not only a McDonald's, but "street prices" so no price gouging. The coffee is the best bargin at the airport for a dollar!


Review 1: Great to finally have a McDonald's here at the airport. "Street prices" posted and food is good along with all the drink options. Service is quick and coffee is hot!


Review 2: I mostly agree with Javier, but I observed a bit of confusion when it came to queuing orders and delivering service with a smile. For example, order number 384 was ready before order number 362. That is just silliness. Maybe each register has its own sequential numbering system? And the staff all seemed a little blue. Cheer up, you're missing opportunities to smile and bring joy to friendly people! :)    =)   ;) ...  ... The airport in Phoenix is called "Sky Harbor." That conjures a romantic and optimistic notion, doesn't it?! I like to imagine that someday in the future, we will have floating airports that are real sky harbors, in a truer sense of the word. Phoenix will have a tricky one because it's kind of windy up there! Anybody who has landed at the airport knows that. It can get a little bumpy. ...  ... If you are a steampunk person, you might imagine that the sky harbors will be filled with dirigibles! And they will dock and make clanging noises. Maybe a grand elevator will bring goods and people up and down to the sky harbor. Or maybe there will still be an airport under the sky harbor. I haven't really thought it through. ...  ... I was on my way down to Mexico for thanksgiving. It was really fun.


Review 3: Glad the prices were not the airport gouging norm.  ...  ... Food was expected and came out pretty quick. They get slammed in spurts when planes come in and take off. ...  ... The bad ...  ... We went there 2 different times 9 days apart.  ... 1st time we ordered a 10 piece chicken nugget. They gave us two boxes of 4 pieces. ... The manager apologized and said the guy missed counted. She gave me a 6 piece but it only had 5.  ...  ... Next time  ... I ordered a couple breakfast burritos and hash browns.The clerk asked if I wanted hot or mild salsa, hot please. My wife got a egg mcmuffin and I also got a sausage muffin. ...  They forgot my wifes egg mcmuffin.  So I go back. ... OH there are no hash browns. So I go back ... Great no salsa. They asked me and IT WAS ON THE RECEIPT.  So I go back

Review 0: This Mcdonalds is remarkably clean and has an excellent morning staff. The food is great and the coffee is a touch of above what used to be.The folks in the evening seem to have less care regarding the food though. Good customer service all around.


Review 1: This store is almost equidistant from the other one I frequent. Always use the drive-thru. They are quick and I do not worry too much if I see a long line there. Food is mostly always hot and fresh.


Review 2: Not sure what is up with this place, but it's been pretty poorly run for years.  Tonight the place was packed, the line for the counter was out the door, and 1 register was open.  Staff were tripping over one another back there, so it didn't appear to be a staffing issue.  The manager was filling fries...oblivious to the line. ...  ... It's like this every time I come in here... ...  ... 3/29  So I just had to add to this post from a few weeks back, because I stopped here the other night on my way home from work.  It's only a mile from the house, otherwise I'd find another one. ...  ... Anyway, I hit the drive through at 9:53PM, and after about a minute of silence I finally got the person working it to realize I was there.  I placed my order, and saw three cars in front of me.   While I was waiting for my food (chicken nuggets and fries) I entertained myself by watching the manager walking around the parking lot.  18 minutes later (yes, 18) I FINALLY got to the window and another couple of minutes later got my food.  For the amount of time this took, I could have killed, plucked, cut up and cooked the chicken myself!  I guess it was too much to hope for that I may actually have a pleasant experience here.


Review 3: There has been multiple time have came here around the 3am hour and they have refuse to take my order due to "technical difficulties" then why are u even open 24hours?


Review 4: Went thru drive thru they forgot my drink I went inside to get my drink I had to wait in line the girl at drive thru argued with Me and said She gave Me my drink like I was trying to steal a diet coke IDIOTS


Review 5: WORST MCDONALDS EVER!  ...  ... 90% of the time they get your order wrong and sometimes at night they only accept cash... This place is poorly ran by a very rude manager who can't even get an order right when he takes it. He also wouldn't take the time to fix it. Do yourself a favor and take your business elsewhere!

Review 0: New building  So clean so nice so.fast


Review 1: Teenagers Stepping up to Fish Combo... oh the days if the simple Cheese Burger and nuggets...\ ...  ... Nice work Kiddo


Review 2: This is me eating my words.  I mocked those who reviewed McDonald's locations and now I myself am doing that exact same thing.  Here's where I will try to redeem myself as a Yelper - I am not reviewing their food as much as I am reviewing the decor. ...  ... I will admit that McDonald's is a guilty pleasure of mine.  There are times their french fries call out to me in the night or I crave McNuggets dipped in sweet & sour sauce.  I may be drooling a bit right now, in fact.  What keeps me from frequenting there as I did in high school is both the knowledge of what goes into fast food and the fear of the oil and grease.  The fryer smell both draws and repulses me and I feel my skin getting greasy just from the proximity.  Nevertheless, if the call is strong enough, I will look beyond all that and get me a McMeal.  Such was the case recently. ...  ... After an evening of wine sampling ("wine tasting" would imply that it was in small quantities, which it was not) my fiance awoke with a mean McCraving.  He is a recently reformed fast-fooder and had gone from frequent visits to the drive-thru to having avoided it for nearly a year.  We decided that if we were going to cave, we might as well check out the recently-leveled-and-rebuilt McDonald's.  Figuring that they were new enough that the fryer, exhaust fans, etc. would still be free of too much buildup, we ventured inside. ...  ... This is seriously the best decorated McDonald's I have ever been to.  It has a mid-century modern feel to it with retro chairs, patches of dark wood flooring and what I can only describe as raised-circle-in-a-square ceramic tiles surrounding the drink/napkin/ketchup area.  I can seriously see some of the design elements being incorporated into a cool modern home.  Flabbergasting is how out-of-place it is in that area of town, where most commercial makeovers seem to involve stucco and tan paint. ...  ... We ate our food in awe of our surroundings.  Was this the future of McDonald's eateries?  Or just a fluke?  I'm hoping it's the former.  If I'm going to stuff myself with fast food, it would be nice to at least do so in a visually-pleasing environment.


Review 3: What the Heck?!?!?! ...  ... I went in to grab a bite. The store was beginning to get busy and the cashier had a lot of people in line. I ordered and was waiting for my food. I noticed this redhead employee who was wearing a white shirt and black tie. I assumed her to be the manager, what caught my attention was that food was sitting and this women was busy TEXTING on her phone. Why would you text during work?? Then I watched her finish and place the phone in her back pocket. Without walking over to WASH her hands she picked up food bagged it and handed to customers. Then walked back over and started the text message again. REALLY? Not only are you too focused on the texting, but also cross contamination of food. I really do not know how clean you phone is. I am surprised that more people did not notice it. When it got to my food I asked that she wash her hands to pick it up or have someone else.  Beware of this location.


Review 4: Awful service. The employees and supervisors just act like they don't want to be there. Stood In line then cashier just leaves and supervisors and other employees just ignore you.


Review 5: awful, people hand out here all hours of the night, panhandling and everyone smokes outside of front doors and side doors. ... no one does anything, i reported this over and over, now it is being reported to the state.  also, no one gets the orders right ... and hardly anyone is at the counters, and no one speaks english.


Review 6: How often is it you see a chain fall so far from the standards for such a long period of time and yet corporate seems to just let them limp along.  It's a new , ok relatively new building but it doesn't look it.  ...  ... Tonight is the second night we've been in a two month period were  no fountain drinks no cafes or drinks other than bottled water, apple juice or milk were around. It's not like we frequent the place but  when someone puts out a habanero burger I feel obligated to support em.  ...  ...  Sadly the burger was the least juicy, scant of dressing one I've encountered so while it hints at getting hot there's not enough  on it to find out.  ...  ... They appear, no let's be bold here and state it , they reheat / refry  their "premium" crispy chicken wrap   it's nasty even before you get to tonight's surprise which is rancid ranch... Yeah a bite and a run to the trash can to hurl it out.. ...  ... As usual  no receipt, no real F's given about the lack of drinks, slow service  in fact  the opposite of the one up at T Bird / I17   If you have to eat  fast  and can go the extra couple of miles it probably will save you time and  result in edible food


Review 7: If I could this place no stars I would.  Slowest drive thru ever. Literally took 20 minutes to order. Then I was told to pull up and wait some more after I paid. They actually have designated spots for you to wait in which tells me they know how slow they are! This is not what I call fast food. NEVER AGAIN.  Next time I will just drive down the street to BK or Wendy's.


Review 8: This McDonald's needs some serious help from customer service. The manager melody should not be a manager but in the back peeling potatoes. They continuously get the order wrong and make customers wait 25-30 min for a redo. Go thru it yourself and see what I'm talking about . Melody's body language suggests she is burned out and does not hold the McDonald's core values.

Review 0: Why am I reviewing a McDonalds? Because I have to tell you about how awesome the employees at this specific location are!  ...  ... I normally go there during lunch or in the morning, they are always courteous and they get the orders out really fast.  ...  ... Recently, on what can only be described as the world telling me to go screw myself, I had locked my car keys in my office, only to realize it when I was at the park and ride in Tempe after taking the 45 minute light rail trip, having to go back to my office, where the alarm was activated which meant no access, to having a dead cell phone and a debit card sitting comfortably at home, I had to walk to a nearby walgreens and purchase an 18 dollar phone charger. The girl at the walgreens said they couldn't plug my phone to an outlet to charge. At this point it is dark outside, and I can't even remember the phone number of anyone that lives in this city to come and pick me up. ...  ... So I am walking alone on central avenue at 7:30 at night and I make it to this mcdonalds, and I ask if they will charge my phone for me and they do! I might as well eat dinner, so i order off the value menu and get my food. While I'm sitting there wondering what in the world I did before smart phones. Talk to strangers that's what.  After a nice conversation with a woman who was eating her dinner before going to work, I was handed a milkshake that had to be remade because the customer asked for no whipped cream, the girl said I should have it because I was having such a bad night. ...  ...  ... So thank you MCDonald's employees, I will visit this location even is its just to buy an iced tea and I will forever be grateful!


Review 1: CLOSED! This McDonalds has closed. Gone are the days when I used to conveniently walk here from work to pick up a drink on my break or get some coffee in the morning. Apparently the sales at this restaurant were not enough so it moved to a new location in a more centrally located area with easier access for customers. ... Funny thing is I still see people try to go through the drive-tru and park to go into the restaurant.


Review 2: Staff are very friendly, a lot of times the hashbrowns and fries taste and smell like the fish.  Need to cook the fish in a separate fryer.  Clean inside and outside.


Review 3: GONE. ...  ... The sign is down; the store is empty. This happened a couple weeks ago, about the time that the architecturally impressive McDonald's staffed by zombies opened on 7th Avenue and Indian School. ...  ... On my one past visit, this one wasn't irritating to the point of berserk rage, which for McDonald's is a major success.


Review 4: Very fast coffee in three minutes, ... not open 24yrs here but really fast on getting your order.


Review 5: This is for Deb: ... I drove to the box that talks back.  I ordered a Quarter Pounder with cheese meal.  With a Diet Coke.  Yeah, I drink Diet.  Not because I think it will even out the bad of the meal, simply because that's what I drink. ... I got my food quickly.  I barely remember eating it and gave the last few bites of my burger to the dog, along with a few fries.  The fries were good. ... The ice in my cup was really, really cold.


Review 6: This Mc Donalds is no better than any of the other  Mc Donalds that are out there.

Review 0: People who wine and dine at Mcdonald's get a bad rap. Why? Because people who don't dine at Mcdonald's aren't living and are therefore jealous. The truth is only about 20 percent of the population can full unlock the euphoria tunneled away in every bite. We are higher spirits of a different breed than the everyday jealous Mcdonald hater. "Why you hatin" was perhaps invented to suit the likes of these people. For me and my intricate complex neurology, I realize what Mcdonald is was and will always be. That is perfection. It's only because we share this trait in common that we understand eachother.  ...  ... Love you Mcdonalds, ...  ... One of your equals


Review 1: HOW THIS LOCATION SAVED MY WAISTLINE! ...  ... Okay, first let me get this one straight, I like fast food burgers - a lot. But, that day finally came (and it comes to us all) when I thought "Hey these jeans are too tight, I suppose I should put on my fat pants instead" Only to realize "OMG! These ARE my fat pants! aaargh". ...  ... That was it, the moment had finally arrived when in-between sorrowful sniffs the road forked in two directions. My lovely wife asks what's wrong and all I could say was "nothing, sniff, sniff" and when she asked if I'd like to go out to dinner to cheer up I heard the voices on my shoulder talking to me. I had to make a choice. Did I? ...  ... A) Embrace the devil on my left shoulder and go for it whilst casually mentioning that all my clothes were so last season and we should go shopping together tonight too! ... B) Listen to that long forgotten voice on my right shoulder saying "HAR, HAR, You just got reality checked! Now do something about it." ... Well, after another 5 minutes of futilely looking in the closet for clothes that fit, then seriously considering if the credit card could take the beating of a of new wardrobe of clothes I let the top button on my jeans stay open and finally decided that enough was enough, it's time to take the second choice...but I was damned if I was going to give up burgers while doing it. ...  ... So, here's what I did. After a year of eating out too much, and a new baby in the house I knew it would have to be cheap, so I cast aside thoughts of Subway and went to my old Favorite - McDonalds! The very next day I started myself on what I came to call "The McDonalds Dollar Menu Diet". ... I posted it to my Facebook page and at first my friends thought I was kidding until they saw the weight continue to come off, week after week. ...  ... For lunch 4-5 days a week at this location (and a couple of dinners a week) I would have a McDouble, a Side Salad with Paul Newman's low fat Balsamic Vinaigrette or low fat Italian salad dressing and either water or a large Diet Coke or large unsweetened Ice Tea. It cost me just $3.27 per meal including tax! I was filled up, had energy and a balanced diet. If I skipped the drink it was only $2.18 per meal. ...  ... This diet I chose and stuck to has put me from borderline obese back to the lean healthy figure I last had 10 years ago. Thanks McDonalds! ...  ... 30 lbs later I swear that I never want to go back to what I was, but I still eat my "McDonalds Dollar Menu Diet" at least twice a week because it tastes so good. (Actually, I just finished another one for lunch...) ...  ... So, instead of blaming McDonalds for supersizing America I now happily say thanks for the healthy choices!


Review 2: This location is in a scary neighborhood. ...  ... But, the inside was renovated with McD's new interior design.  So it looks nice and well kept up thus far. ...  ... The cashier I got tried to charge me for using my Living Social deal. He said it was just $1 off, when in fact the LS deal was prepaid for already.  I told him to ask his manager and she would correct him, which she did. ...  ... Fries were good.   ...  ... I likely will return to this location, but maybe not at night.


Review 3: Good and fast service.  Long drive-thru lines (they have 2 lanes) during breakfast and lunch time.  If you go into the dining room, you might even get your food faster than the drive-thru line.


Review 4: My fat ass loves this place. When my fat ass wants some greasy fast food this is the place I go. Sometimes my fat ass orders the McDouble and a Spicy McChicken and stacks them on top of each other. It does, however, send my fat ass directly to the McToilet. ...  ... This location hasn't ever tried to charge me for buffalo sauce either (like some of the other cheap ass locations have)


Review 5: Stopped by here one my way to Flagstaff so that I can have some food in my stomach and to keep me awake. The chicken nuggets and fries were actually really fresh and crunchy. It was until I went to the bathroom and realized that this place was disgusting. The bathroom was filthy and when I walked out, it was then that I noticed that there was trash and napkins on the floor and the employees just walk over it.


Review 6: I understand that with fast food you can't be terribly picky, however, tonight they completely dropped the ball.  ...  ... I ordered 2 fish filet meals, large. I received 2 medium drinks and some cheeseburgers. Ok, you'd think it's a simple mix up... No. I had to argue with 2 employees to get my order right. I left somewhat upset only to be even sooner angry. I was 1/4 of the way through my fish filet when I found a black piece of plastic... Safety hazard, I'm sure.  ...  ... I really enjoy McDonald's from time to time, but unfortunately they were unable to keep up their end of the deal - "great" fast food and service.


Review 7: phone  review -well I was going to use 2 medium free fry tickets we got via the monopoly game. But apparently you have to have 2 people in the vehicle...1 ticket get person. So I can order 2 grilled chicken sandwich combos and pay full price  and they don't give a crap...But to piece meal the order to get it cheaper...it required 2 people in the car. J and I both call Bull shit. Keep your shit food. I'm going to Chick-fil-a.


Review 8: Wish i could this place zero stars but i guess  the one star could count for good fries and apple pies

Review 0: What can be said about a Mcdonald's? They have recently required all of their franchises to make their prices consistent, so there's no hidden gems selling $1 chicken nuggets or 4 cookies for $1 anymore. The food is usually the same wherever you go. ...  ... The ambience, however, can make a regular visit into a special one. Such is the case with this location. The kids and I stopped in for a quick breakfast visit while my wife was at a meeting nearby. We were immediately drawn to the walls of the restaurant, which were covered with dinosaur posters, figures and facts. The kids were ecstatic! They started looking at all of the dinosaurs and asking their names and pronunciations. We ordered our food and headed toward the play area. What a surprise to see huge dinosaur models flanking a very large play structure! The entire restaurant was painted in a jungle motif, as well, so it gave the impression that you were in a Paleozoic forest. Very cool! We plan to come back soon so the kids can get a chance to crawl around more in the play area. ...  ... Sadly, they have a design board on the front counter showing the elevations of their remodel. They plan to turn it into a bland, faux-upscale Mcdonald's. According to the renderings, the play area, dinosaurs and any hint of a unique experience will be gone. Lame! ...  ... If you want to give your kids something other than a generic fast food experience, head here quick, before the dinosaurs are extinct!


Review 1: Pretty much a normal McDonald's with the exception of the odd Jurassic park pkayland..the kids enjoyed playing there but I am sure I will suffer t Rex nightmares in the coming days..lol


Review 2: Standard services for a McDonalds.  Service drive thru was fast an food was hot.


Review 3: Ok there are to many complaints about the employee's. Do you think most of them want to be working at a minimum wage job? Don't expect them to be too happy all the time... and for the most part they are nice and helpfull. I would like to complain about the customers more so... some of them get to angry for food, like seriously it's just food dont get yourself to worked up. And for the record I would like too say that McDonalds coffee lids are the best invention ever, every other coffee lid, like at Tim Hortons, NEVER stays open!!! I love the LID!!! It's EPIC!


Review 4: The food is very very fake. When most of the fried products get to room temperature, they melt into a goo rather than just getting soggy. . . Need I say more? Everything has additives, and yes, eating there often will make you fat. It's impossible to avoid with food of that quality. The service is going to depend on who the manager is at the time. If there's someone running the store poorly, people are going to be waiting on food. When people wait on food, they tend to complain... but my problem is its mcdonalds... you get what you pay for. ...  ... I know they add something to the fries to make them addicting, that's why I still frequent this chain store.


Review 5: The manager was RUDE.  We stopped in on a Sunday morning and had to wait a little while for anyone to come to the register to wait on the customers that were ahead of us.  Another employee started to take my daughters order and the manager made him stop, not sure why, but she did.  She took our order and when it was kind of thrown on the counter for us to pick up, she made it known she was not happy that I asked for a couple of packets of mayo. ...  ... Not sure I'll be back, they don't seem to care about the customers.

Review 0: This Mcdonald's is no different than any of the other's when it comes to food at least.....and I have only had there ice cream....and mocha drinks. The one unique thing about this place though is it is always PACKED....I mean the drive-thru is ridiculous. I say unique because it is surrounded by all kinds of wonderful places to eat. There is Olive garden.....red lobster......outback steakhouse....In and Out burger....CoCo's.....5 and diner....Island burger......Laparilla Suiza......Barro's......Chick-Fi-La.......Picasso's........IHOP.....and they are even building a new Culver's and all of this in walking distance of this mcdonald's. Yet these people invade this establishment like it is the last Mcdonald's on earth....don't know whether that is good or bad...but for me I will pass. Eat, Drink. and be Merry my Friends!!!


Review 1: As much as I like the breakfast at McDonald's, I will no longer be going to them. WHY? One reason, their Wi-Fi. It is without a doubt the absolute worst on the planet. Dunkin Donuts and Starbucks are fantastic but McDonald's is very, very, very bad.


Review 2: Been here a few times, just a normal Mcdonalds, well, was. Pile of rubble as of 07/01/2014. Don't know if they're rebuilding.

Review 0: Probably the nicest McDonalds I've been in in a while. Staff is friendly, place is spotless, and on table has video games built into the counter for the kids. Pretty cool.


Review 1: This is a nice, clean location, has dual drive thru lanes, and is insanely fast!! I am very impressed with how efficient they are.


Review 2: Why 4 stars? It's McDonalds, that's why. Its consistent but not great. But we were all raised on this stuff so its hard to hate it.  ...  ... This particular McDonalds is clean and remodeled. Service is on the slower side and one time they totally drove me crazy by not accepting a McDonalds coupon that I got in a Pats Run swag bag.  ...  ... I'm grateful to have it in the neighborhood.


Review 3: To say the employees here are rude would be putting it mildly.  ...  ... I come here frequently, not because it is the best McDonald's, but rather because it is the closest McDonald's. The food here is okay at best, for a McDonald's. It's certainly better than either location on Chandler Boulevard. However, my major complaint is that no matter what time of day I come or if I go drive through versus inside, not a single employee thanks me for my business.  ...  ... It especially irks me because as someone who has worked customer service, I always make a point of thanking the people who are providing me the service. I don't think it's unreasonable to expect the same courtesy from people where I choose to spend my money, thus providing them a job. ...  ... Apart from the blatantly rude service, this location seems to have a problem with employees never emptying trash cans. Especially at the drive through. I can't count how many times I've come, even in the morning, and that trashcan is overflowing. I'm not sure if it's a problem for the health department or not, but I can tell you that it's really disgusting to see birds and flies hang around the trashcan right in front of where I'm picking up my food. Food and trash literally overflow. It's a similar case inside the restaurant, especially at the cans near the bathroom. ...  ... Overall this is an okay McDonald's if you just need one that's close by, but don't expect it to be a great McDonald's.

Review 0: McDonalds is an American fast food restaurant which is slowly gaining popularity in the Phoenix Metro area.  They serve hamburgers, french fries ... ok just kidding ...  ...  ... This is the McDonald's right by my house (btw, is Yelp! safe?) ... and the reason why it's being reviewed is because at lunch time the drive-thru is SUPER SPEEDY!   ...  ... I drive by three McDonald's to get here and they all have ENORMOUS lines, but not this one! ...  ... Big UPS!


Review 1: I asked for no onions and pickles but I might as well have asked for a punch in the mouth because I got neither.


Review 2: I only come here to get their 99 cent bags of ice that are advertised all over their outside windows.  ...  ... Unfortunately, out of 6 visits they have only had the bagged ice once. Why??? And offering me a large cup of ice for the same price is not gonna make me happy Mr. Manager. Just bag that ice up....


Review 3: This is the short bus of all McDonald's. ...  ... Unfortunately after the economy bit it McD's decided they really didn't want most of the stores open 24 hours everyday and just left a couple of them in the Valley.  This is the one closest to my work but its not like the store locator on their website tells you that. ...  ... One, there are ferociously long lines after bar close.  Hint, you might want to leave another location to the east and North open to help.  Like the one on Camelback or Indian School.   ...  ... Two, if I come at say 3:45am I never know if they are serving breakfast or lunch at this location.  The schedule seems to be determined by how things are progressing in the lunar cycle.  Crack in the Box has figured out how to both simultaneously, why can't McDonald's? ...  ... Three, they can't figure out how to clean their shake machine one side at a time or change when they clean it based on business volume or say overnight temps.  My thought is that if it is not going to go under 100 overnight they should maybe leave it on and clean it 7am.  If I am at loose ends at 3:45 am I may want a shake if its hot out, eh? ...  ... Four, and this is the worst.  I have actually been sitting in line to pick up my food after ordering and listened to the window person chat about the morning news with the vehicle ahead of me.  This has happened more than once!  Are you freaking kidding me?  This is fast food not your local coffee shop.  Oh, wait.  Now they have McCafe so people are confused, right?


Review 4: Bad service. They were slow to give my order even though they were only a few customers that time. Also I spotted a few homeless guys just outside sitting. Not only that, the place isn't all that neat. Find a spots of dirt on the floor. If it weren't a request of my niece then I wouldn't have gone here.


Review 5: Bag was stolen by a store employee while I sat and listened to my iPad eating lunch. Caught on video, store manager and owner covering up the situation. Police are now involved and detective investigating the video. Store employee never reported anything to a manager and cleaned out my bag in a cleaning closet in the store.  ...  ... Homeless use this location as a sanitation station. Be prepared to be asked several times for money.  ...  ... Homeless change clothes right in the store.


Review 6: Gonna wait next time a mcflurry craving hits... My mcflurry looked like there was only one Oreo mixed in and half of it was outside the cup.  ...  ... Got hounded for change coming and going, then a fight broke out in the Parking lot as we were leaving. Gotta remember not to return here ever! Yeesh! :-/


Review 7: I only went because I had a coupon for a free Bacon Clubhouse Burger which was as expected... blah.  With all the wonderful Non Fast Food places to get a burger these days (at a fairly competitive price) why ever choose fast fast food?  Really?  Why? ...  ... I haven't been to McDonald's in about 5 or 6 years and no reason to ever go again.


Review 8: I've been to this McDonald's twice, one month apart, and I've had the same experience twice. ...  ... The hash browns are gross. They taste like they've been fried in old, burned, rotted oil. This is the only McDonald's I've ever been to that's had foul tasting hash browns. ...  ... Both times I've sat inside and both times I've overheard the same bitching several times over... .the manager having to continually tell a male employee (not kidding around), "stop being mean to the customers" and "be nice!"


Review 9: It was a terrible experience in every possible way. The wait time in the drive thru lane was excessive, the order was incorrect, and the chicken was slimy and smelled like it was rotting. I haven't eaten McDonald in over a year before trying it again and I found it to be just as disgusting as the last time.


Review 10: Seriously my frappe was chocolate water disgusting! ... How hard is it to make a blended drink? ... Sorry but frappes are like my crack so don't mess that up.


Review 11: Slowest DRIVE THRU ever!!!! Also the quintessential SHORT BUS Location. ...  ... I frequented this location around dinner time since it is the closest to my home a few times and every time it is between a 10-15 min ordeal. When i worked at Mickey D's in the early 90's we had what was called 90 sec HBO( Hand Bag Out), from order to picking up should be no longer than 90 secs. This must not be a practiced any longer.  I have to say hello when I drive up to the speaker due to getting no response. Then I get someone who is rude and say's yes. I order the big mac deal, buy 1, get 1 for a $1. The employee says they do not offer that, I advise their menu out front does. After 5 min of silence and cars backing up I pull fwd to make sure he is still living to see what is up. Total lack of cust serv service, he had to have the mgr show him how to ring it up, no apology or anything. This happened each time I went there. C'mon man

Review 0: Girlfriend says "Want McDonald's for lunch?" ...  ... I'm super hungry.  But I've been trying to do no fast food for Lent.   ...  ... Girlfriend says, "Oh yea, you weren't eating fast food yet, right." ...  ... I see the golden arches in the distance.  Quickly slipping I say, "Um, do we have food at home for lunch?"   ...  ... Girlfriend says, "Not really, we need to go grocery shopping." ...  ... I freaking kid you not, while we wait at the red light freaking church bells go off right behind us.  Yes, automated, on the hour church bells.  I couldn't make this stuff up. ...  ... I say, "Um......" ...  ... The light becomes green and girlfriend says, "Let's just get it.  We'll go shopping later."   ...  ... I hadn't made the decision, so somehow that made it better.  I dove in with both feet. Bring on the Big Mac!!!  Coke has never tasted so cold or so good coming out of that giant straw.   ...  ... And finally, in an act that could almost be a sign from the big G, the McDonald's that has never ever gotten our order completely right - got the whole thing perfect.   ...  ... So if you ever go here, and don't hear the church bells, check your order before you pull away from the drive through as in the past this location actually gave us 2 double cheeseburgers with no meat.


Review 1: Ok, it's a little silly to review a McDonalds, but I was getting some photos developed at the drugstore next door & was a little hungry for lunch, so I popped into this McDonalds.  The seating was comfortable, the service was friendly & fast, my Angus Bacon & Cheese Burger was delicious, & so was the large ice cream cone for desert. ...  ... As I munched down on this big boy, I glared out the window at 1-Star New Sun Star Super Buffet across the street, & 2-Star King Wah behind it.  This taught me to appreciate McDonalds & write this review.  It's all relative, isn't it? ...  ... Spent $4.98, left happy!   :-))


Review 2: There are lots of restaurants on this corner (including 2 Buffets!), but you know how sometimes you're just hungry for McDonalds?     :-)     Ok, never mind. ...  ... So I stopped in here this afternoon for a bite to eat.  When I was here last, 8 months ago, they had just remodeled the place & it was nice inside.  Well, they have remodeled it AGAIN!  Unfortunately, the new floor plan isn't as good as the former one, in my opinion, & they could have bought a lot of paper towels with what they spent here, bringing me to... ...  ... Next gripe:  Last time, along with the air blower in the bathroom, they had an empty paper towel dispenser.  Now, they don't even have that?  After blowing your hands off how are you supposed to open the door without getting them germy again?  (I got lucky when someone else opened the door, but this is no way to run a restaurant!) ...  ... Ok, here's what was GOOD here today: ...  ... *  Super fast service!  Less than one minute from ordering to receiving my food, even though they were busy. ...  ... *  Everything was put together neatly and served up at the right temperature. ...  ... *  The menu board now shows how many calories are in each food item!  I'm still going to eat too many of them, but at least I've been warned!  This IS the way to run a fast food restaurant!     :-) ...  ... *  Excellent value!  I had: ...  ... *  A McDouble (double cheeseburger):  $1 ...  ... *  A Hot & Spicy McChicken Sandwich:  $1 ...  ... *  A perky little Chocolate Shake with whipped cream & a cherry:  $2.19 ...  ... Yay for a tasty meal for $4.19!  Ok, it was also 390+360+570 + 50? (extra mayo on the chicken sand.)=1370 Calories.  Ugh, but I can't say they didn't warn me.     :-O ...  ... If they'd had paper towels I might have given it 4 Stars.     :-)


Review 3: It's taken me 2 1/2 years to get back around to this McDonald's, here in my neighborhood.  In the meantime, they have done a complete remodel, & it's nice inside, featuring a clean, modern look, & game computers to use (free) at two of the booths!     :-) ...  ... Unfortunately, there WERE some issues this morning, more important than getting to play a game along with eating.  To start with, there was a nice new hand's free paper towel dispenser in the Men's Room, but no paper towels in it!  I tried to dry my hands on the silly air blower for a while, & then when I gave up on that, had to use toilet paper to open the door.  Not ok!     :-O ...  ... There wasn't enough help, so the service was slow.  Also, the coffee also tasted hours old.  (I usually really like McDonald's coffee.)     :-O ...  ... This location could be at least one more Star if they'd just tighten up their act a little. ...  ... Sausage McMuffin with Egg $1.79, Sr. Coffee $.89


Review 4: How do you say retarded in Spanish? ...  ... We ordered fish filet meal and cheese burger happy meal (ketchup and onions only) ...  ... We got the kids meal and a fish sandwich with ketchup and onion...WTF who does that? On the fish? Come on...


Review 5: The kids that work here are uneducated with lots of attitude. I asked for a double hamburger, so they gave me a mcdouble?? I don't understand how one can misunderstand this! Then they want to stand there and say its they same thing. I shouldn't have to ask for a mcdouble with no cheese if asking for a double hamburger should make sense right!! The only thing that made this trip worth anything was the manager that was super nice and friendly!

Review 0: Great playground at this location, perhaps among the better ones as far as McDonalds goes.  Service is quick, food is typical, but the playground puts this one on the map for me.


Review 1: I'm not one of the people who think that they are better than McDonald's. I actually like the taste of the dollar menu items, so life is cheap for me. This location is the closest to our house, so it's the one that we frequent the most. They're one of the few locations to have four piece chicken nuggets for $1 for the kids, so that's a plus. The McCafe, while obviously not specific to this location, is a cool concept. The drinks are pretty good, and about half the price of a Starbucks. The thing that this location is in dire need of, though, is an update/remodel. The inside decor and the seating areas have a worn-out look to them. It seems that every other McDonald's that I've been to recently has been refurbished. They all have the cafe look to them now and some have really fancy play structures. Other than that, the staff is usually very nice and helpful, and we rarely have any mistakes with our order. The extensive dollar menu offerings and helpful staff balance out the dated decor to leave it with three stars for me.


Review 2: Plastic, really, really, really bad for you in sooooooo many ways, shape and some nasty looking forms...but hey, when you come here you are pretty much kissing your 60's goodbye. ... Take it's yummy, bacon filled, processed, cheesy, murdered cow goodness with a dollop of cardiac arrest thrown in for good measure in moderation.


Review 3: Still 3 stars, but the fly problem here is getting annoying. They need to get an exterminator or hang some fly strips or something.


Review 4: Went through the drive through and the lady at the Window was nice. She did her job well. When I received my food however I was not so impressed. I ordered a #10. The food was fast, too fast. The chicken was undercooked and the iced coffee was all ice and no flavor.


Review 5: Meh .. staff is very short assy but overall clean.. what do you expect it's Mc Donalds not Deluxe Burger at the Biltmore... place is dated I rarely eat here kids had gift cards from Christmas....management needs to look closely at this location


Review 6: I am livid as I write this. I rarely eat at McD's, but I do stop in for a McRib when it is offered. That was our reason for going this time.  ...  ... Our order was 1 Mcrib, 1 Qtr Pounder, 1 Big Mac, 1 side salad, 1 drink, 1 fry. Five items and a drink.   ...  ... When our bags came through the drive thru window, we did a cursory check and had 5 items in the bag in a quick, efficient manner. When we got home - we had 1 Qtr Pounder, 2 Big Macs, 1 fry, 1 salad and drink. Yeah, it is five items + drink. Not the CORRECT five items.  ...  ... I drove back with 2 big macs, receipt and bagging list (both of which listed mcrib and 1 big mac). I went inside and spoke with the employee there. I said I would like to return the 2 big macs in exchange for a new big mac and a mcrib. He turned around and had the cook make a new mcrib, which he promptly handed to me and said I could keep the other 2 big macs.  ...  ... WTF? How much more plain can I make it? I want a FRESH big mac AND a mcrib, not TWO bigmacs that are now half an hour old (they will be by the time I drive back home).  ...  ... I didn't even bother to argue the point. Why? The store is equipped with thousands upon thousands of dollars in equipment designed to take orders, cook orders, and track orders. The whole process happens in an area 500 square feet. But somehow, even with all of this high-tech equipment tracking your order from start to finish; something as simple as getting FIVE items in a bag correctly is beyond the capability of the multiple staff members that is preparing/checking and serving that order in those 500 square feet.  ...  ... I came home -  and ate a bit of my mcrib. I didn't eat the big macs as they were cold, and who wants to reheat burgers laden with lettuce and special sauce? That's just gross. It could have been a nice treat, but instead I had to log onto the internet and spend what could have been dinner time letting you all know that things like caveat emptor still apply, especially at drive thru windows. Cursory item counts aren't enough.. you have to VERIFY what each item is. I'm paying good money for simple items which are tracked by complex systems and multiple personnel yet somehow such a seemingly simple task can go wrong in the matter of a few feet. I just don't get it. Thanks for nothing, McDonald's.


Review 7: This McDonald's order came with two sandwiches that had hard bread.  When shown to the manager, he explained they were toasted and had no clue between toasted bread and old hard bread.  I'm 31  years old, I know by now how McDonald's bread should be, and how managers should behave - and it's not like this.  Also, you need a code to enter the restrooms.  There are Mcd's on nearly every corner here, don't choose this one, I know I won't.

Review 0: Fast drive-thru, slow service inside.  Hardly any counterspace inside, as though they really just have this place for the drive thru customers.  Food same as any other McDonalds.


Review 1: So it's just a McDonald's.  So what?  Well, unfortunately (or maybe fortunately) the are not all created equal.  I have been to this location several times.  The staff is friendly for a McDonald's, but I would say it takes roughly twice as long to get my food as it does at other locations.  I don't think I have ever received my food where there wasn't at least something left off of my tray, like a drink, or french fries.  There are so many McDonald's to choose from surrounding this one, I might keep on driving an extra mile or so and visit another location.


Review 2: Let's face it, McDonald's isn't exactly gourmet fast food, but at least it's fast, right? Wrong! This location blows. The drive thru is unbelievably slow. Worse, I'm not sure what I just ate; the first bite of that Egg McMuffin tasted like dish soap, and it was cold! I might also make one suggestion. It might behoove the owner/operator to have a person who speaks English working the drive thru.


Review 3: This is the worst Mcdonalds ever the manger looks like a fucking creep and there service is slow... They forgot my ranch and made my plain Mcdouble with extra ketchup.


Review 4: Well after a long 14 HR. Day at work I wanted to grab something fast and easy...  well not fast at all in fact a little over 10 min just to get too the food.  I can handle that. But when I went home too eat my food there was hair.  I called the manager to confront her about it...  the answer I got was I don't know how that happened. We don't have anyone with long hair working the grill. I was offered to have the food remade but between the wait,  hair,  and being questioned. I don't want it remade...  I feel bad giving this place one star

Review 0: I really like the remodeling going on


Review 1: McDonald's is McDonald's. My "beef" with this place is they stopped selling ice and I prefer not to have to drive all over town in search of ice while wearing pajamas!  ...  ... (See http://www.yelp.com/biz/mcdonalds-restaurants-phoenix-44#hrid:jpfxQUBZMuBoIIFn-MWp7g)


Review 2: Pros: It's McDonald's. the food here is OK, and the location is convenient to my house. ...  ... Cons: slow service, long lines, and have had to pull around several times because of messed up orders. the actual customer service is terrible here. no more ice, especially on a day like the 4th of July. friendly, NO!.  ...  ... never been inside this McDonalds location, only in the corner store, which is a different story! ... I guess convenience come with a price, not physically but verbally!


Review 3: Don't plan on picking up a quick cup of coffee-or anything else-on the way to work! You will waste an easy 10" getting through the drive-through: first No One is manning the order mike and when you get to the window to both pay and get your order-there is complete chaos! They seem uncertain as to what you ordered-try to hand-out a completely wrong order-or are surprised you are sitting in your car outside their window in the first place! This place has ABSOLUTELY the worst McD 's  service of ANY I have been to in this country! Isn't there some award they could receive for this distinction?


Review 4: Was there Friday morning around 9am- rudest young guy working the order window and took our payment. That guy has no business in the customer service industry.


Review 5: went back there today and asked for two simple burgers with nothing but ketchup and cheese, not hard, right? apparently it is if your english is as good as your order taking skills

Review 0: I never expect much from  drive thru - its McDonalds right.   ... Well the cashier was perky, friendly and professional - okay? ... The second window was just as friendly and professional and attentive. ... WOW - I was super stunned - nice job who manages that store


Review 1: K, I had to search for this specific McDonalds.  ...  ... Like I said before, it is what it is. I rate things for what they are beyond what they are... does that make any sense?? ...  ... Anyways, the people here are super friendly. There is a weird trend with fast food in this area- the workers are all oddly friendly. This place is the same way. I really can't justify a 5 star rating for a McDonalds, but I will give it 4 stars considering it's a great place to drive through for a dollar drink from time to time.


Review 2: Stopped for breakfast yesterday morning and they were supper fast and everything was fresh and just as I order. Did I mention that the staff is supper friendly? I live close to the McDonalds on Bethany Home, they are terrible. I'll drive out of the way for always fresh French fries from now on.


Review 3: Staff are friendly, but their internet is sloooooow. I've been here 20 minutes and my iPad is only half done in downloading today's newspaper (not the big Sunday paper, it's Thursday). ... Follow up: download of the paper took 32 minutes, but now I gotta leave.


Review 4: Every time I go to this McDonald's I fill like I am bothering them.  I am a simple man. I order the same thing every time, off the menu And they get it wrong every time.   The guy that's on the register is straight up stupid.


Review 5: Its a McDonalds...


Review 6: Slowest service ever, sitting in drive through for ten minutes now :(  ...  ... Not very good, drink was watery...

Review 0: McDonald's drive-thru is the girl who's in her pajamas and in for the night but decides she wants a Manhattan and realizes she is out of ice's best friend. $1 for an 8 lb. bag (2 for $1.50) and you don't even have to get out of the car!!


Review 1: This is the worst McDonalds i have ever been to. (period) ...  ... Actually I go there quite often, and every time I have been there the food always has dries up particle of mustard ketchup and other food items. ... I don't think i have ever been inside this restaurant and I'm 99.9% sure i never want to.  ... I went through the drive thru and some "estpido extranjeros ilegales" were deliberately switching mics and speaking Spanish then switching back and laughing while trying to take the order.


Review 2: This place is more miss than hit, I stop by here for breakfast on rare occasions and the food usually comes out more than slightly mangled.   ...  ... The food is usually edible and the customer service at the window is always friendly.  I've never had the experiences that Phoenician C has but I will admit that this can be one of the lower end McD's that I've been to in this town. ...  ... Curse you McGriddle!!!


Review 3: Another filthy Mc nasty. The ice machine had no ice and and the girl taking my order seemed pretty slow and there was a ton of purple smoothie on the counter where I placed my order. So I asked the manager for some sauce besides ketchup for my fries and he states the sauce is usually .15 and acts like he's hooking me up...I tell him we're even for the ice situation. Anyways, with the playland in its current condition,  this place is doomed to be an accident waiting to happen.

Review 0: McDonald's is getting a bad rap here, I can see.  Yeah, it's not the best one out there, but it's not the worst.   Ive only been here for breakfast, so that's what im basing my review on.  I use the drive-thru.. maybe that works too.   ...  ... I get my usual vanilla iced coffee and oat meal in the mornings and have never been disappointed.  The girl at the pay window always seems friendly and has is smiling all the time.  The girl who gives me my food is the same way.  Only time I've had problems was this morning when the manager of all people, didnt give me my spoon!! serious!!!..  just kidding.   ...  ... It's McDonalds.. not a 5 star restaurant..  :)


Review 1: Ok,, so I am not a big Mickey D fan.  I wanted a mid morning snack and a sausage biscuit so I pull in here only to realize they are being remodeled.  Now I am under the opinion that nobody but the infirm and mothers with screaming babies have the right to add to the carbon footprint by using a drive thru but by this time somebody had already pulled in behind me.  I got what I asked for and a smile at the window.  They fulfilled my expectations so they get a full 3 stars.


Review 2: I went here to be picked up by a friend, so I decided to grab something to eat ... The guy at the counter seemed a bit too timid to take anyone's order...but at least he actually stopped to take my order...unlike the other girl and guy. Anyhow, the food took a while to come out and it was pretty decent...it was hot. The only true downside is the bubbly brook that is my stomach and I didn't even eat my sandwich...but that's McDonald's for ya haha!


Review 3: I know.  I know.  I know.  I know.  Why am I wasting my time yelping about a McDonald's.  But hey sometimes I crave a double cheeseburger and some fries or some hot cakes and an egg mcmuffin.  Also, I am a firm believer that a burger shouldn't have mayonnaise on it.  They are one of the only chains that don't put that disgusting crap on their burgers.  Plus, they serve the best diet coke.  I don't know what it is.  So, please don't hate me.   ...  ... But damn this place is the worst McDonald's I have ever been at.  Every freaking time I have been to the place they have messed up my order.  They either forgot the fries or forgot my sandwich or they don't have pickles for their burgers.  How the hell do you run out of pickles!!!!!  I love pickles..  I really do...  I always order extra pickles when I get a burger.  I only live a couple blocks from this place and I avoid it at all costs and go to one that is 3 miles away.   ...  ... So if you are craving some Mickey D's keep on moving past this location.


Review 4: I went here to grab a happy meal for my son while getting my car washed for my niece's swim team at the same location.  The play area is dirty.  The employees are not friendly.


Review 5: It's McDonald's: How do you fuck up McDonald's?  Easy--hire no one who speaks English, consistently serve cold and stale french fries and generally let the store be filthy.   I'm so glad I live in the quasi-ghetto!


Review 6: Okay so I'm not really a huge McDonald's fan but I come here a lot when I bring girls for mentoring. So as we are sitting and doing work out of a book on a Sunday night (paying customers) the girl that I'm mentoring is smoking her electronic cigarette (no scent and nothing harmful... even airports allow them), the manager literally YELLS across the restaurant "YOU CAN'T DO THAT" and is completely rude and unprofessional. I understand rules and don't mind abiding by them, but to be rude and brash? Unnecessary. Not to mention my burger was cold and there was no ketchup in the containers. The restaurant was practically empty and there was no line. I worked in the restaurant industry for years, I was absolutely disgusted. We won't be coming here to do work anymore. What a jerk?!?

Review 0: This location is good  nothing special about it but over all the service is good and food is OK.


Review 1: We don't eat at McDonald's on a daily basis by any means, but every now and then in a pinch, we stop here because it's less than a minute from our house.  ...  ... We have yet to ever leave with our entire order 100% correct. They constantly give us the wrong food and usually leave out one or MORE things we ordered.  ...  ... Staff is unpleasant and the managers don't care if you say anything. They're equally unpleasant. Would not recommend this place! I ONLY gave them two stars because the inside is clean and that's important to me.


Review 2: Drive Thru is a NIGHTMARE.  Food is cold more often than not and the orders are CONSISTENTLY WRONG.


Review 3: I'm basically 99% sure I wrote a review of this place about 8 months ago and now there are...no reviews. Is it possible for them to take stuff down? No doubt they wanted all previous reviews removed...it's not just me, the previous stack of bad reviews was proof that this place is seriously the worst McDonald's ever. Frankly I'm surprised that McDonald's Corp continues to allow them to operate this franchise location. Ronald McDonald would roll in his grave. Basically 60% of the time we're told to park. And if it's not me being told to park and wait it's usually the person in front of me. The ice cream machine is "out of order" or "down for cleaning" (your pick) more often than not. WHICH IS TOTALLY AWESOME WHEN YOU'RE IN LINE, SOMEONE PULLS IN BEHIND YOU, YOU ORDER ICE CREAM, THEY DON'T HAVE IT, THEN YOU GET TO WAIT IN LINE TO GET THROUGH THE DRIVE THRU! It would be brilliant if they would post that before the point of no return in the drive thru lane. I don't know what the deal is, if management/owners just don't care or if they don't know what's going on. I'll sum it up with my most recent drive-thru experience there: ...  ... Girl: "Hi, welcome to McDonald's, now featuring the Cherry Berry Chiller! What can I get you?" ... Me: "Can I get 2 medium Cherry Berry Chillers?" ... Girl: "We're out." ... Me: "But you just said you had them..." ... Girl: "No, I said FEATURING. We don't have them." ...  ... And she probably spit in the Sprite I got instead.


Review 4: It was late Sunday night, and we were hungry and this is the only place open late.  We went to the one on Gantzel, but they weren't accepting anything but cash, which our bank ATM is inside Fry's which was closed.  So we come here, place our order, and our fries are half full, and the buns on the cheeseburgers were so stale the dog wouldn't even eat them!!  No lie!! There was one, very unhappy, seemed put out young woman working the drive through and sorry, but not a good experience!


Review 5: Wow! What crappy service!! I waited in line at the drive thru. I got to the speaker finally, and they asked me to hold. Sure, no problem. 11 minutes later, and several cars that went into the other lane after me, were all served. I drove up, got to the window and complained. I got an I'm sorry. Then was told I had to drive back through to place my order. I THINK NOT!!! I will never spend another red penny at this place!

Review 0: I rarely eat McDonald's but my toddler loves their chicken nuggets and this location is one of the only fast food restaurants near my house. I have always had such a pleasant experience here- one time I asked for a cup of water and the guy at the drive through winked and gave me a bottled dasani on the house. Today I went through the busy drive through for a kids meal and was told at the second window that my food wasn't ready and to pull up to the parking lot "drive through number 1" spot. After about 5 minutes they brought out a fresh kids meal and had added in a warm apple pie just for my wait. The drive thru servers are always so polite and although the food leaves much to be desired (it's McDonald's for heavens sake), I appreciate the service when I do visit. The training manager deserves a pat on the back for expecting these minimum wage kids to work so hard!


Review 1: Not too bad. The fries are "ok". You may get cold ones or you may get hot ones. Everything else is usually pretty cool.


Review 2: Typical McDonalds. Nothing special either good or bad.


Review 3: Absolutely the worst service ever!!!  I waited 18 minutes at the drive thru on sunday afternoon/evening.  I was looking around for the camera because I thought someone was playing a joke.   I took a photo of the receipt as well.  Just a happy meal for my son and after the ridicules wait they tried to give me a dr pepper instead of chocolate milk...  wish I could give 0 stars.


Review 4: If I could give this no stars I would. I went through the drive thru, ordered a Big Mac combo meal. I opened it and it was soggy. It had definitely been sitting around. My fries were literally half filled. And the big mac had no sauce. I walked in and politely asked them to add sauce. The manager (or whoever it was) told the cashier to inform me that there would be extra charge. First of all, I ordered it WITH sauce. I informed the cashier (since the manager refused to talk to me) that I wasn't  about to pay extra for something done right that I ordered. Nobody was in there when I walked in. So it shouldn't be a problem right? I told them that I work at a mcdonalds, and this isn't how customers should be treated, especially because I was so calm about it. The cashier finally comes back and says, "they put a lot of sauce" and threw the box at me practically. I didn't take a picture but no exaggeration but it was literally COVERED in sauce. I had to use 8 napkins to wipe the sauce off and even then I couldn't even wipe off the excess. So annoying. I called in and asked politely to talk to the manager just to let them know, and they hung up on me. This experience was ridiculous.


Review 5: There drive through staff is terrible. Never get orders right and they repeat the wrong orders about 10 times.  I have never gone here and got an order right.


Review 6: This McDs is the only fast food restaurant (besides Filibertos) open late in this part San Tan Valley, and you think that they would want to have as much business as possible... Then why do they only accept cash most of the time if you go there between 1-4 am? I don't carry cash and especially not that early. I then have to drive all the way in to Queen Creek to get Jack in the Box. That's insane to only take cash (it's not just a one night thing either.) I'm sick of this McDs. Of all the bad service I've had, this one is the worst.


Review 7: Very disappointing visit to the Gantzel Road McDonalds.  We went on a Wednesday night.  There was a small line at the drive through but the line did not move at all for several minutes.  Then we waited for over 5 minutes before the order taker would take our order. We finally received our food and headed for home.  When we arrived home, we found that they had neglected to give us a 20 piece McNuggets that we had ordered and paid for. I was upset because somebody did not receive their dinner. I called the McDonalds and complained that we were missing part of our order.  The manager, Michelle, told us to write her name on the receipt and bring it back later and our order would be replaced. After hanging up, I proceeded to eat my food.  One item I had ordered was a Deluxe Double Cheeseburger.  I bit into it and my mouth was soon on fire.  The server had mistakenly put HOT Jalapeno Ranch sauce on my burger.  I could not eat it and threw the rest away.   ...  ... The next day I sent my son to the McDonalds to retrieve the missing 20 piece McNuggets.  We ordered additional food so that everyone at home would have something to eat. Guess what?  When my son got home, again there was missing food.  We had ordered 2 additional 20 piece McNuggets and one of the now three orders was missing.  Also missing was a large French Fry.  This was an incredible amount of incompetence that occurred during two trips to the restaurant.  My advice is to be very careful using the drive-through.window.  Count your items and make sure you have everything you ordered before leaving for home.


Review 8: went to this mcdonalds today to get my 4 y/o daughter pancakes..advised at the speaker computer down..pull up to second window after an 18 1/2 minute wait got the food..asked to speak to manager if any discount for this wait she listened to my request and walked away did  not say anything else after saying sorry computers are down..i'm a 55 y/o  who does not care if computers are down not ..not my concern maybe they should have someone out side taking written orders to help speed up their process..like in and out burger.. this store is one of the worst not caring for the customers...always have to call the corp customer service line to complain..and yes i know stop going there..but only store that makes pancakes any more...too bad wendys stopped or i would not have this problem or issue


Review 9: Wow!!  EVERY time we go here, usually for a late night, drive thru run, as we are busy and work tons, our order gets messed up, missing food, or cold  EVERY time!!  No kidding!!  Plus, the fries are usually cold, stale, rarely full, the buns are hard, I mean thump when you flick them (yeah, we had to do this, out of shock!)  One time, we even received a cheeseburger with NO PATTY!!  Of course we didn't know this until we got home!  It's enough that my family KNOWS they MUST check the order EVERY time before they get out of line!!!! They are slow, not polite, and just don't care!  OH, and the other night, Sunday night, on a late night run again, we put in our order thru the drive thru, and then were told they only could accept cash at that time!  Huh, we had to leave.  GRRRR!!

Review 0: The employees are all exceptionally friendly and appear to appreciate my business. It's very nice to be treated so well. The food is normally fresh but the egg white delight sometimes has a crunchy English muffin that seems a little older. This isn't all the time though. Overall I have had great experiences there.


Review 1: This is the closest McDonald's to my house.  I like to hit it up for breakfast every once in a while.  I also get dessert here when I have a sweet tooth.  I have never had a problem here.  The staff is always friendly.  Even though it is in a gas station it is really nice for a McDonald's.


Review 2: I will occasionally stop here for breakfast.  When I do, I order 2 Sausage McMuffins w/no Egg, 1 Hash Browns, $3.27.  The drive thru lane can get slow and jammed up....there's not much room for more than 2 or 3 cars to be in line at the ordering speaker before it starts getting messy. ...  ... One convenient aspect of this location is that there's a gas station attached to it. ...  ... Return Factor - 50%


Review 3: Gas station McDonalds!  Well they keep it fairly clean inside, and there's minimal seating, and the drive-thru moves fairly quickly.  Plus you can get gas while you're there.  Had a couple errors on my orders but they're fast at breakfast time.


Review 4: ******** Apparently Seniors Are NOT Welcomed at ANY Of Their Locations ******** ...  ... I stop at McDonalds  perhaps three times a year. ... I don't like McDonalds food. ...    ...                    ********* The Coffee is Another Story ********* ...  ... I have no qualms with it. ... In the past ..... I order a "Senior Coffee" ...... and leave. ...  ...         ********** McDonalds is GREEDY ********** ...  ... They NO LONGER offer a Senior Coffee.


Review 5: There are a few reasons why I never go to McDonalds.  1--bad food.  2.--which I just experienced, is an incompetent work force. Unfortunately I live right by this one.   I drove through and ordered a Large Diet Coke.  So I order, I'm told $1.09, pull ahead, blah blah blah.  Anyways, i'm sitting behind the car in front of me for literally 8 minutes.  Now i'm not positive, but I'm pretty sure Mcdonalds has a company policy where large orders that take this amount of time are required to "pull around" and wait to have their food brought to them, to allow small orders, like my Large Diet Coke which takes 13 seconds to fill, "fast food" service.   Well, not so much.   So 8 minutes go by, i'm waiting, i'm waiting, i'm waiting (and there's nowhere to exit at this location), finally I pull up to the window.  Hand the lady my card she runs it, hands me my card, receipt and I realize i've been charged $9.00+.  SO i Say this isn't my order, blah blah blah, and she gets the manager.  Manger yells at the employee, explains proper procedure (which is another time consuming task), all the while i'm sitting here and I just want my fucking Diet Coke and card refunded.  So now i'm dealing with the manager.  Literally took her 2 minutes of constant swiping of my debit card to get it refunded.   She hands me my drink, then she hands me the receipt.   Two of them, first showing i've been refunded, and then she says "the second one is for the drink.", and then she says, "I'm sorry about the wait." ...  ... I told her if she was really sorry I wouldn't' have been charged for the drink.   ...  ...  ... Are you serious?  I just waited in line for 14 minutes for a large fountain drink and you, the manager, the person in charge, don't even have the common sense or courtesy to give me the drink for free?  Are you serious?  Complete and utter incompetence and completely unaware of what the term customer service means. I'm not pissed about being charged $1.  I'm pissed that my time was wasted.

Review 0: Only mcdonalds i have been to that has spicy chicken sandwich for 99cents. amazing even though Mcdonalds in general is a 1 star place i loved spicy chicken sandwich. Must be high concentration of mexicans that they feel need to spice everything up or that is at least my brother who lives in Scotsdale says. He is puerto rican and asked if he is asked if he is mexican daily lol gotta love arizona. I would totally take my girl here for a romantic and intimate dinner of spicy chicken sandwiches


Review 1: This location is never too busy, clean, staff is friendly, and quick. Here is my synapsis on the current state of McDonalds.  ...  ... McCaf and Breakfast: I went to Starbucks today and paid $6.43 for a Latte and muffin and it wasn't that great. I would much rather have a Vanilla Iced Coffee and Egg McMuffin from McDonalds, it's always tasty and consistent. ...  ... McRib: Rib Meat shapened into a Rib Bear Claw is awesome, I don't care what you aristocrat haters think. ...  ... Salads: Buying a salad from McDonalds is like going to a Mexican restaurant and ordering a cheeseburger. Besides, I don't think I trust salad from a giant fast food corporation. ...  ... Snack Wrap: A satisfying 'in between' meal. ...  ... Burgers: Kinda weird burger meat, but unique, kinda good.


Review 2: Fairly decent location. ... Weird setup but I guess that's just the way they do things these days.  Compact front of the house where you place your order.  It's like the soda fountains are right behind you.  If you get out of line and there's someone behind you waiting to order you will probably have to excuse yourelf to gain access to the soda fountain. ... The dining area didn't seem very big, in fact it almost seemed to be drawfed by the childrens play area. ... Why?!


Review 3: I've come here several times for lunch and it's never busy.  I like it because it's clean, has plenty of seats, and the employees are nice.  I rarely dine inside of a McDonald's, but every once in a while, I will get a Big Mac Attack and come inside to take care of it. ... http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mcdonalds-scottsdale-8?select=4qc_FPKhJYUNJ6yTJmc0xQ#4qc_FPKhJYUNJ6yTJmc0xQ ... http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mcdonalds-scottsdale-8?select=GTHNeWe4bo06DkZtEg6Sfg#GTHNeWe4bo06DkZtEg6Sfg ...  ... I've also tried their new Angus Bacon Burger.  It's not bad.  The Bacon is the super thin kind, which I don't really care for, but the Beef is better than their regular Burgers. ... http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mcdonalds-scottsdale-8?select=XTgR8kBOQSGBsQ0b0HtR8w#XTgR8kBOQSGBsQ0b0HtR8w ...  ... Overall, this location is OK for a Mickey D's. ...  ... Return Factor - 50%


Review 4: Okay, so lately, I've been eating McDonald's more than I should (for breakfast). ...  ... This one is the closest one to my house and it's just fine. I mostly go through the drive-thru, and they're pretty quick with orders. When I do go inside it seems clean. The workers all/mostly seem competent enough. Honestly, I remember this McDonald's used to have the most incompetent workers some years ago. Like, to the point where I'd avoid coming here, even when I wanted McDonald's (who does that?). Glad to see things have improved...


Review 5: The fries were solid as usually, but I thought that my mcnuggets tasted a little off and underdone.  They weren't as crispy as they should've been.


Review 6: I just grabbed two burgers and a fry to go. I got home .3 miles away and my fry's were limp and room temp and the buns look like they are at least a month old to the point that I lost my appetite and  tossed them in the garbage.

Review 0: Review wrong restaurant.  This one is located in Walmart.


Review 1: I don't really fast food but I love the McDonald's hot fudge sundae. It's $1.30 and really hits the spot for something sweet.


Review 2: I've been to the McDonald's a few times, only through the drive thru.  What's really  impressive is that they have a double drive thru, which means there's 2 ordering lanes that converge back into 1, so you can process orders twice as fast.  What's impressive is that to keep up, they have to get the food ready at twice the speed.  I'm not sure why this particular location does this, but it's pretty cool....I've never seen anything like that before. ...  ... The food here is average McDonald's food....nothing much to really talk about.  I stop here to grab Breakfast on occasion when I'm on the go and nearby. ...  ... Return Factor - 60%


Review 3: This is a convenient location near the Cobblestone Gas/Car Wash inside the Walmarts near the 101/FLW Blvd exit. ...  ... The service is good, the food is ... well McDonalds good, and it's a good place to wait for your car next door at Cobblestone or Discount tires! ...  ... Enjoy!


Review 4: Slow service inside.  Somewhat rude cashier, and for no reason.  Small and awkward layout inside, especially for the limited seating and limited standing area to take an order.  Sub-par as far as McDonalds go.

Review 0: A clean and terrific place to lunch and watch the kids play. We were served our mochas, one free with coupon, by Kerrie. Thank you so much! Just as good as Starbucks.


Review 1: Pumpkin pies are the new Eggnog Shakes - only seasonal and only here for a short amount of time. The pies were 2 for a buck and contained a decent, but not perfect Pumpkiny tasting filling. The crust was the same as on the apple pies. Only went there for a small cone, but tis the season, so I obliged and was happy with my fast food pie.


Review 2: Sausage McMuffin with egg sandwich and a small coffee with a cream and a sugar: $3:88 ...  ... Why this Mickey D's? ...  ... They're fast. I'm entering the drive-thru at 7:15 and leaving it at 7:18.  ...  ... Location. A stones throw from Raintree/101. ...  ... Consistency. Each day my Sausage McMuff tastes just as good as the day before and the coffee gets me going in the morning. ...  ... Healthy? Eh, sort of. You can get the sandwich and coffee for just shy of 500 calories. The fine print is that they make up for calories with fat and cholesterol. Though, you can substitute the eggs for egg whites. That way you pay the difference now (in cash), instead of when you're 60 (in bypass surgery).


Review 3: This Mickey D's is convenient to those traveling on Frank Lloyd Wright eastbound or either direction on the 101.   ...  ... This McDonalds is clean and epitomizes what fast food should be.  They offer a fast, efficient and friendly fast food experience, so I believe they deserve the five stars!   ...  ... One suggestion -- since they close to Cobblestone Auto Spa (literally next door), stop there first for gas and a car wash and then walk across the lot and wait for your car to be ready. ...  ... Nice!


Review 4: Dude. It's McDonalds. I don't know what exactly you're expecting. ...  ... Although this location does now have the dual order windows and 24 hours drive through. No word on the late midnight breakfast though. ...  ... Would've given this place four stars from over the years, but recently I've been getting sass from the drive through window late at night. Yes I understand it's tiring, but I never had to deal with attitude at Jack in the Box down the street.


Review 5: "And they did feast on the fillet O'fishes, big macs, chicken mcnuggets, egg mcmuffins, cheeseburgers, french fries, and mcchickens. And the Lord did smile upon them and smote their enemies that did give their bodies to the Burger King and sodomized themselves with unclean whoppers. ...  ... But the people of the Arches did thoust sin against the Lord and cried out to the heavens. And the Lord did sendith down the Hamburgler who tooketh all hamburgers, cheeseburgers, quarter pounders, big extras and big macs, and there was a terrible famine in the land." ...  ... The book of Ronald Chapter 15

Review 0: Slow service occasionally but overall a good Mickey D's. My favorite helpful newer employee there is the girl that goes by Angelica


Review 1: We go here because my husband can use the free wi-fi. We like the friendly people that work here as well. ... Debbie H


Review 2: McDonald's food is Mcdonald's and we all know that going into it, but at least give me decent service. Part of that is getting my order right which shouldn't be hard since I only order 3 things....2 burgers and a drink. ...  ... How I ended up with the wrong drink, one burger and chicken nuggets, I don't know. However, they did do a quick fix for me with only minor attitude for ordering my food right and them getting it wrong.


Review 3: My double cheese burger and Medium fries were trash worthy. The wrapper was hot so I thought the burger would be.... WRONG! The fries were warm but not fresh, you know how they get when they have set for awhile under the heat lamps.  ...  ... However much to my surprise my frozen mocha was very good. ...  ... I called the toll free number and gave them feedback, first time I was ever moved to do that at a McDonalds! They are to mail me out a coupon to replace my burger and fries. I will not be cashing them in at this location that's for sure!


Review 4: Slow service and occasionally rude people working. I know it's only McDonalds but what happened to pride in work, whatever that work may be.


Review 5: This is the slowest McDonald's drive -thru that I have ever encountered. How in the world do they turn a profit?! I only wanted an ice cream cone and I had to wait over 15 minutes in line for it. The guy's order ahead of me was still on the screen when I pulled up to give my order. He ordered 2 large sweet teas. You would have thought that they had to go out, harvest the tea leaves, and retrieve the water from the well!


Review 6: i have been to this mac probley 6 times in a 5 year peroid and have gotten food poisening twice the latest boute 2 days ago on a cheese burger this location needs to be reported to the health inspectors. eat here knowing you have a good chance of being poisened


Review 7: I literally waited in the car 10 mins before the order came out in the drive thru! Did someone say fast food!?? Oh and it wasn't even for me

Review 0: I am not gonna review the food honestly cause well its McDonalds, it's pretty much the same food every where.  ...  ... The Place-  This place is super clean, it's the cleanest location I have ever been to. ...  ... The Employees- I was actually in tonight at 7pm ordering inside, Kyle was the cashier and was very nice when I asked him a ton of questions about the new food items I saw on the menu.  Another employee who always gives me great service is a blonde girl who runs the window late at night a lot.  ...  ... This is the only McDonalds I like.. Keep it up guys :)


Review 1: Love my local McD's. Food is prepared well, never get the wrong order and staff is friendly. Great place to cool off and get some lunch. This location also does a ton for the community with the fundraiser and teacher nights for schools and local nonprofits. Good community member.


Review 2: They are usually pretty good but lately they have been getting my orders messed up. By the time I get to work and discover that my Order is wrong, it's too late to go back.


Review 3: Serves expired food: -2 stars. (I mean come on, the date and time are printed on the package) Expecting something to be wrong every time I go there: -1 star. (I'm feeling generous today) In reality I have more good than bad experiences here, but the bad ones like: expired food, cold food and rude employees are big. Why do I keep going here you ask? Cuz it's cheap, 24hrs. and practically at my front door.


Review 4: The Golden Arches, the most famous fast food place, and always will be. The food isn't exactly fresh, but it's not bad either. ...  ... Because the menu never changes, other than seasonal specials. I've eaten most of the menu in a very long space of time. I'll start with the Big Mac, I've eaten a lot of them, and they're not all great for me. I just think the middle bun makes the whole thing dry, especially when you have two ultra thin burgers that have to be cooked to oblivion. I LOVE the Big Mac sauce, so that's why I buy it again. I usually buy a Double Cheeseburger, I love American cheese, and it's so simple. I also adore pickles, although I do wish they ridged them thicker cut. The best meal on the menu are the Chicken Selects, the breading is herby, salty and crunchy, and the chicken juicy. They come with custom sauces, and I tend to buy one sour cream and one BBQ, two BBQ's means you have to buy another milkshake to tame the spice. ...  ... The only side I buy at McDonalds are their famous fries, there is no point in buying anything else, because it's too expensive for what they are. The fries are amazing though, when they are cooked properly. Crisp, addictive and beautifully salted. They eclipse KFC and Burger King. I always have them with pepper, it gives them a kick. The sauces are great too, the ketchup is clearly Heinz, but the BBQ sauce by the pump is smoky and sweet, and very delicious. ...  ... The milkshake is the best though, I love sweet things, and with a milkshake you always have enough to quench your thirst polishing off a Big Mac, and then enough to count as dessert. I always get chocolate, but prefer the vanilla, it's a shame you can't get it a lot. Desserts wise, I ditch the McFlurry and buy a Toffee Sundae. A sizable amount of soft serve, a generous drizzle of toffee, for 99p. Cheap, and delicious. ...  ... So there's my review, it's not great food and you know it'll kill you if you eat too much of it, but there's something about it that makes you come back, and that's why is the most popular fast food chain in the world, and always will be.


Review 5: I live very close to this location and after today, I will go out of my way to never dine at or get food to go from this location ever again.  ...   ... It seems as though every time I order from here my order is wrong. It is usually my wife's food that they get incorrect so I have to return to the restaurant so that they can correct the order and by the time I get back home, my food is cold and practically inedible.  ...  ... I've complained to management 3-4 times and sometimes they just remake my order and others they gave me coupons. This is a good policy, but how about working on getting an order 100% correct? Once in a while is one thing, but this happens a majority of the time.  ...  ... My advice, go to the location on 64th st and Greenway. They seem to have it together. Better yet, there is a Wendy's right across the street.

Review 0: When I first moved to Phoenix in 2006 I was so moved by the exemplary service and high quality of McDonald's food at this location that I wrote an email letting them know how I feel. I felt this was the best served, freshest tasting McDonald's food I had experienced and the staff was always great and professional. Because of my praising email, they mailed me two free extra value meal coupons. Very nice. All McDonald's should be like this one.  ...  ... I recognize it is weird reviewing chains (especially a McDonald's), but this one I feel deserved it. Still don't like it? Tough.


Review 1: I wanted to share an update about this McDonalds because the Manager Obviously cares about what folks are saying. I was presented with a number of Coupons and a letter apologizing for the bad service. Since then I've there a couple times and my order has been taken and provided without ANY FLAWS!! ...  ... Great job and KUDOS to the Mangers for fixing all issues.


Review 2: Not really sure why everyone are giving this place a bad review.  I don't usually rate chain stores, but since they offer a lot of choices under the $1 menu for people on the move, I usually just get those items.  I get fast services every time I go there, it's hot cheap food for less.  Always the correct orders unlike most of the people giving bad reviews here.


Review 3: No Shamrock Shakes!!!!! This was stop number 2 on our hunt to find shamrock shakes well before they should stop carrying them (1 week before St Pattys day). They claim to be "out of the mix today". Right, we have heard of that before. In any other business someone would get fired for not buying enough to meet demand. What is McDonalds problem???


Review 4: I have been to this particular McDonald's location twice now. Each time they have forgotten to give me my sauce for my McNuggets. Of course this was after I left that I noticed, and eating nuggets without any sauce just isn't the same.


Review 5: I wanted to give this McDonalds NO STARS, but I didn't know if I could.  Anyway, if you want your order WRONG, this is the place to be!! I have gone here on many occasions and out of 10 orders, 8 have been wrong. Be careful when Ordering a Sausage McMuffin, you will GET EGG PUT ON IT THERE.  I even took my order back and they gave me the same thing again WITH EGG, when I specifically said SAUSAGE MCMUFFIN!!!  I love all people and I am not racist but, if you gonna work in AMERICA you gotta not only SPEAK English, but UNDERSTAND it too!!!

Review 0: This is pretty much like any McDonald's, there is a drive thru, however, in addition to a playground.  This place knows how to represent the brand.  Five stars!!!


Review 1: it just got an update and it looks so shiny and new! i stopped in to buy a gift card for my mom. she loves riding her bike like 100 miles and stopping at McDonalds for a coffee in the winter, ice cream in the summer. bless her heart! ...  ... i don't eat meat anymore, so there's no real need for me to go to McD's except their coffee is pretty good at a fraction of the cost of Starbucks. great looking store!


Review 2: Damn you Big Mac! Something about that magical combination of two all beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions on a sesame seed bun that occasionally calls me into a McDonalds. Big Mac fans should know that Culinary Dropout (Scotttsdale, AZ) has a gourmet version of a Big Mac that will blow your freaking mind! FYI - They just tore down the old location here and built a new ultra-modern one with a double drive-thru and laptop workstations.


Review 3: De - ja - vu ...  ... It's MikiD's enough said


Review 4: Dropped in here for lunch to try the new Quarter Pounder Bacon Habanero Ranch, $3.99. ... http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mcdonalds-scottsdale?select=aPzAn9mUhH1b90WY8xfjEA#aPzAn9mUhH1b90WY8xfjEA ...  ... I also had a McDouble, $1 ... http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mcdonalds-scottsdale?select=FR409-EseclC8HqhZJ5tdA#FR409-EseclC8HqhZJ5tdA ...  ... At the register was a very friendly and courteous employee named Heather.  Despite the massive line for lunch, she maintained a nice smile and was gracious to everyone including me.  She gets 5 Stars for her service and deserves recognition. ...  ... The new Bacon Habanero Ranch Quarter Pounder was pretty good, but not great.  For a McDonald's it's a pleasant surprise. At least they're trying to improve their products.  The McDouble is a nice, cheap regular item I get. ...  ... Return Factor - 70%


Review 5: It's Mickey D's!   I like the diner style throwback stores better, but this one is close, has nice enough crews and it's inexpensive as well as yummy. ...  ... The drive through does take a bit of getting used to.


Review 6: It's your average McDonald's.  Fast service, average fast food.  I was running around and needed a quick lunch, so I went through the drive through and ordered 2 McDouble's from the value menu the other day.  It's a McDonald's, so my expectations aren't high... ...  ... Not bad for less than $2.50. ...  ... Return Factor - 50%


Review 7: Had I written this review before the remodel, it would have been an easy 4 stars.  Since the remodel, it's been a debacle.   ...  ... First, the double drive through may be good for traffic control in this shopping center, but having both lines merge to one window is not always easily managed.  I've been to the window and been offered the wrong order, only to be given the right order, which turned out to be the wrong order anyway.  There is a difference between egg McMuffins and sausage McMuffins.  That difference is 70 calories and 10 grams of fat.  If they do that to me 50 times, I will gain an extra pound. ...  ... And speaking of food, it's crappy half the time now.  Chicken is dry and chewy...except last time when I was asked to pull around and wait in front.  So much for drive thru.  Had great chicken that day.  Too bad they bagged the fries upon ordering, so they were cold by the time the chicken cooked.  And the fries often have that cold, old grease been sittin' way too long texture. ...  ... And the employees?  They must have had 100% staff change upon reopening: ...  ... "May I take your order?" ... "Yes, I would like a 5-piece chicken strip order, a southern style chicken sandwich, a large order of fries, a small Coke, and a large Iced tea." ... "So that's a large iced tea, and what else?" ...  ... Repeat, Every Single Time.


Review 8: McDs is what it is...but this one has about a 50% success rate on getting the order right.


Review 9: New drive through is a wreck waiting to happen. Two lines ordering at the same time and then you have to get into one lane. It was crowded and everyone thinks they should rush ahead at the same time. What a ridiculous design!


Review 10: Went through the drive through. After placing our order it felt like we waiting 1/2 hour. It was probably 8 minutes, but no one greeted us ,let us know  it would be awhile. etc. ...  ... Almost drove off without the order - had I done that this would be a one-star review. ...  ... The positive? Cookies had just come out of the oven.


Review 11: I am getting SICK AND TIRED of this McDonald's always messing my order up.  Sometimes I liked to go to the drive thru at 7am en route to work so I can eat a McGriddle, Sausage McMuffin WITHOUT EGG and a nice coffee!  I would say that 90% of the time, they put the nasty EGG on the mcmuffin! I am always tempted to check my order at the winder and look at my McMuffin!  I should REMOVE THE EGG part and DROP it onto the concrete!  However, I have not done that.  Instead - I am just NOT going to patronize this particular McDonald's anymore!


Review 12: McDonald's food is always the same crap so I'm not reviewing that.  The employees at this location are rude and they have cockroaches.  Other than that is is like every other McDonald's in the US.


Review 13: They so suck. They repeat my order to me correctly three times and when I get it order they did everything wrong. Don't think she knows how to key in the order correctly.

Review 0: Great 50s decor ambiance and exceptional service. Very clean and fresh food. Glad to see a manager take so much pride. Other McDs should learn from this one. Will come again for sure.


Review 1: I love this mcDonald's not just for its food but for it's 50's decor and ambience. One of the nicest Micky D's I've ever been in, for one thing. It is well kept up and maintained and their staff is top-notch.  ...  ... I love their food and whenever I am in the area, I come for the Saturday car shows. That is one big highlight this location offers and it's free and fun.  ...  ... If you're into classic cars, come check out their show and grab a bite to eat at this fine restaurant!


Review 2: Time for a review update.  I still love this place for the Saturday car shows, they get 5 Stars for that.  It's the longest running car show in Arizona I believe.  It's so much fun and it's free. ...  ... They get a bump up in stars because over the past 2 yrs, they've delivered great customer service and the food is always fresh by fast food standards.  Also, McDonald's has stepped up it's menu and offered a variety of new items that are tasty and unique.  Their Iced Coffee is very good...and I'm not a Coffee drinker. ...  ... I come here primarily for breakfast and an occasional lunch....and the car shows. ...  ... If you have a free Saturday night and like cars, give it a try....especially during the nice weathered months. ...  ... Return Factor - 100%


Review 3: 3 Stars for the food, 5 Stars for the unique experience..... ...  ... I stopped by this McDonald's location for a quick lunch one day and ordered 2 Double Cheeseburgers and Large Fries.  While I was waiting for my food, someone told me about a free car show they host in the parking lot every Saturday night. ...  ... My food was ready and I had a decent lunch.  It's McDonalds, so my expectations are pretty low.  Not bad for a quick meal. ...  ... I then returned the next Saturday night to check out the car show.....it was pretty cool!  There are probably close to 100 cars here....everything from old classics (Chevy's, Corvettes, Camaros, Mustangs) to newer rice rockets (Acuras, Hondas, Toyotas) to exotics (Ferrari's, Lambos).  I was amazed!  Best part....it's FREE! ...  ... By the way.....the McDonalds was packed and making tons of money.....great idea! ...  ... Return Factor - 100% (the Car show was a lot of fun, will definitely be back)


Review 4: When we lived in Chicago, one of the fun things our kids always enjoyed after a trip to the Adler or Science Museum was a visit to the "Rock 'N Roll McDonalds" on Clark Street.  http://www.yelp.com/biz/rock-n-roll-mcdonalds-chicago ...  ... Well, this is our own mini Arizona version of that Mickey Ds. ...  ... Most fast food places can only aspire to Three Stars in my book, given their uniform bland sameness.  The only differentiation are the employees or the theme/setup of the restaurant. How many of us like In 'n Out just for the ambiance?   ...  ... I'm not saying the folks who make the Animal Style have anything to worry from the Oakbrook crowd.  But, this Mickey Ds is fun. It even has pictures (not labeled) of the first restaurant that Ray Kroc built in Des Plaines, IL  It also has baseball cards, and other collectibles throughout the restaurant.  Nice! ...  ... All of the employees who work here seem to care and work hard at keeping the place clean and nice. ...  ... So in Yelp-ese, yes they're "Three Stars, A-OK". They check all the boxes to earn those three stars.  But, I would say they deserve an extra half star for it being interesting and fun, as well.


Review 5: Decided to stop by here (for the first time) last week for a quick fix. I'm not sure if this was an isolated incident, but this was not up to par with the consistency that I would expect eating at any other golden arches restaurant. In fact, both my Big Mac and my girlfriend's were surprising dry! I'm sorry but the secret sauce was not enough to save them! To top it off, we order combos and they really skimped out on the fries (the french fry containers were not overflowing full as I'm used to getting from other Mickey Dee's).  ...  ... Also, since they were new and for a "limited time" (and thank the man upstairs for that), we tried out the McBites instead of our usual McNuggets, only to find ourselves in utter disappointment. The McBites were super dry and very hard with very little meat to be found. They were more like fried batter that were sitting too long under a heat lamp. I'm not sure if I'd ever give this location a try again, there were just too many strikes in one instance. Moreover, we went through the drive-thru so it's not like we could've complained to the manager if we ate inside. Overall, this was a bad first impression at this location.


Review 6: It's rare that I leave myself enough time to have breakfast before schlepping to work, but today happened to be one of those days (purely by accident (aka stupid garage door drama) I assure you!) so I head over to the McD's and order a #1 (Egg McMuffin) w/ a chocolate chip frappe... ...  ... Let's get this straight, right out the box...there are 4 stars for the frappe and my crispy delicious potato and negative 2 stars for the McMuff due to the dried up crusty piece of gristly canadian bacon and the not fully cooked egg...gross!  ...  ... G'bye protein! So I ended up with a grilled cheese english muffin... ...  ... I guess I should in some way thank them for pushing me one step closer to being the vegetarian I occasionally toy with becoming. My stomach is still churning at the memory of wet egg in my mouth. *hork*


Review 7: I don't normally write reviews about fast food joints... In fact, I don't normally EAT at fast food joints.  ...  ... I pulled into the drive-thru for a quick chicken sandwich before a movie. I ordered my food, nothing crazy, just a crispy chicken sandwich with a little ranch added. I pulled up behind a car at the second window and then WAITED FOR TEN MINUTES. I know that isn't a huge amount of time, but what the hell were they doing in there? It's McDonald's! It's supposed to be super fast! When I finally got to the window, it was then another almost five minute wait. I asked the guy what was going on and said "there was a mixup with my food". Huh? You mean my lonely little chicken sandwich with ranch and pickles? Jeez, sorry to confuse you all! ...  ... Well, i finally got it, with like 5 minutes to spare before my movie. There was barely any ranch on it and it was cold. Blech. ...  ... This just reinforces why I never eat at crappy places like this. I guess it's my own fault.


Review 8: Lol Watch "Food Inc" Then try to eat here ok? lMFAO :-)


Review 9: Went for breakfast this morning, and a roach crawled up my leg while sitting at my table. Went in the bathroom to get it off, and they were all over the place. Disgusting! Never eating here ever again.


Review 10: Went tonight (Saturday) and ordered a dipped cone for my grandson. Was told they had no dipped cones..hmmm.  Ordered a small French fries. They were the worst ever I have ever had at a McDonalds. They were cold, rubbery, and almost as bad as the manager who refunded my money after my insistence. This during the Saturday night car show . Store busy, no excuse for bad food and service. Will not be visiting this McDs again.Will gladly pay extra and go to Dennys...

Review 0: I don't care what anyone one says.  McDonald's is Great.  There is nothing better than their cheese burgers and fries. Not to mention an Egg Mc Muffen for breakfast.


Review 1: Great service.


Review 2: While my daughter was enjoying the awesome play area, I was afforded the opportunity to reminisce about how treacherous this location's drive-thru can be. ...  ... If your order is easy, naturally, all is well. But if you order a large or specialty order that requires you to pull into the "we need more time to fix your stuff" spaces,  look out. ...  ... These spaces are located just past the second window at the end of the drive-thru, just as the lane turns left and narrows. So, if  you drive a big vehicle, you'll end up blocking the whole lane, causing a massive traffic jam.  ...  ... So, a word to the wise...if you are ordering a lot, bite the bullet and go inside. It'll most likely end up saving you time and unnecessary frustration.


Review 3: Becareful of this drive through location, they could care less if the order is accurate.  My order this morning was short by two, yes two b-burritos.  Sadly this is normal and why I cointinue to visist this location and use it's drive through is beyound me.  I have written to the coproate office, as the reviews for this store are horrible.  Maybe it's time to shut this place down and put in a burger king???


Review 4: awful.  food is never right.  girl at drive thru (black)is very ... rude and nasty, so is gina.  will not come back to this mcdonalds. ... wifi is never running, people are spending money and th owners ... here do not care about making wifi work.  no one speaks english ... and the food is not cooked all the way, and the drinks never right.


Review 5: I ordered a meal and asked to get a napkin to wipe soda off of the side... apparently Nallelly didn't like that. When I asked for honey and bbq. She gave me bbq and I asked again for honey. She rolled her eyes grabbed honey. Whispered to her coworker and they both laughed. She then hands me a sliced open honey.  Refused to give me her name but I read her badge.  I called manager and he blamed it on box cutting knife.  " I'll ask her about it but I'm sure she didn't do it. " I told him I saw her. He said "I'm sorry but all I can do is ask her what happened it was just the box cutting knife." No offer to call me after he  talked to her and follow through with me. Nothing. Bad service. Bad management.  NEVER AGAIN.


Review 6: The husband asked for McD's tonight so I humored him and agreed to go. I figured DT wouldn't be a problem since they are normally pretty fast. The car infront of me at the speaker was placed on hold for every bit of 5 minutes. They ordered a single cone. Now it's my turn, I place my order with the unfriendly crew voice that clearly came across the speaker. Of course after I placed my order and pulled forward I realize I didn't order everything. I figured that I'll just pull around and go in and order the forgotten items. The young man at the cashering window apologized to the car in front of me for the wait. I pull up, he takes my money, returns with the change (without a receipt) and tells me to pull forward. No apology for the wait when I waited forever as well. My double digit order was obviously less important than the $1.08 cone in front of me. Now I feel slighted, upset and undervalued. I pull up to the window, the young gal verifies two items of my order and begins the hand out process. I check the bag for the receipt, it's  not there. I ask the gal for a receipt, she asks "he didn't give you one?" If he did why would I ask for another? Hello? Really now!?!  I pull around, park and head inside to see a single line with 7 people and a lone cashier that was not happy. I begin to wait (I'm not so patient at this point) and wait. Two people in front of me walked out due to the wait. There were no smiles, no personality from the counter cashier or the manager who finally decided to open the second register and take an order or two. Each guest was asked for their name that was then written on the receipt in an attempt to personalize the service. A friendly smile would have gone so much further. Finally it's my turn, by now there are two people behind me. I place my simple order of 6 doubles plain, and begin to wait again. the time stamp on the recipt was 7:05. Every guest that was ahead of me was called for pick up. I'm thinking my wait would finally be over. Oh heck no! It wasn't that kind of visit. The two guests behind me received their orders before me!! I continue to wait, really upset by now. I was finally called, the time is now 7:15pm. 10 minutes! This on top of the 10 minutes in the DT trail. Once again no apology for the wait. The store was obviously understaffed, the interior had numerous dirty tables and many trays stacked on the garbage receptacles. The staff was completely underwhelming and in my opinion rude for not offering an apology for the extended waits at both the DT and the counter. I will not be returning to this location as it is not fast and they certainly didn't value my patronage. I certainly don't need the aggravation and honestly I work too hard to spend my money where I'm not appreciated!


Review 7: Went for coffee at this McDonalds today.  Three of their rising stars were in the drive through line, eividently the microphone at the menu had the day off.  With three of their brightest doing the work of a sign and a microphone, the line was backed up and getting worse by minute.  The courtesy of the staff was beyond lacking and the dolts who lined up for McDONALDS was scary.  I went inside to get my coffee having given up on the "helpful trio in the drive through" only to be met by the team who weren't good enough to qualify for the parking lot gig.  I would recommend dumpster diving over going to this restaurant.  Unless you are in a coma or have nothing else better to do, I would avoid this place.  WOW.

Review 0: I wanted Sweet Republic, the plus one wanted something cheap after all of our baller status meals.... cheeseburger for him...... I got some more of that ice cream hehehe.


Review 1: McDonalds.  Hummm... ...  ... Good food.  Quick in, quick out.  Clean restrooms.  It hasn't changed much since Ray Kroc made the template over 50 years ago.   ...  ... You may not like that McDonalds exists, but the food is well prepared and they execute on their stated goals.   ...  ... Sorry, if you wanted your burger animal style -- then go to In-n-Out!


Review 2: Eff you McDonalds, eff you!  ...  ... You told me you had "Real Fruit Smoothies" that were blended to perfection and offered at a reasonable price. You drilled that idea in my head for weeks with your incessant advertising on the sides of buses and mile high billboards with pictures of creamy, fruity smoothies that made my mouth salivate instantly. You knew that I loved smoothies so much that I would go to great and dangerous lengths to obtain one of your so called "Real Fruit Smoothies". You knew that even though I loathed you and everything you stand for, that I would risk it all, risk everything to venture into your mustard arches to try one of your smoothies.  ...  ... As soon as I walked in and looked around, I knew immediately that I didn't fit in. I won't get into specifics, but let's just say that many of your patrons have the "I don't have a job and I don't care because I get unemployment checks" look about them. Just sayin'. After I made my way through a throng of screaming kids running around barefoot, I finally made it to the counter. I decided to play it safe and order a strawberry banana smoothie thinking that you couldn't possibly mess that classic flavor up. I wasn't actually able to see you make this "Real Fruit Smoothie", as it was mysteriously whipped up behind the scenes in the back somewhere. I would say that next time I'll pay more attention, but unfortunately for you, there won't be a next time.  ...  ... After I made my way out of that hell hole and into the safety of my car, I took my first sip of your much hyped smoothie. I was instantly disappointed. By the time the liquid mush you call a smoothie hit the back of my throat, I knew that I had been duped. I took one more sip just to make sure that I hadn't missed something the first time, and threw the rest out.  ...  ... McDonald's....come on. You don't make a "Real Fruit Smoothie" by blending up strawberry juice and banana flavored puree with some ice and yogurt and call it a smoothie. You're supposed to use REAL FRUIT! That drink was about as "real" as Joan Rivers face, or Pam Anderson's boobs...you might fool some dumbasses out there, but I think most people would rather pay a few bucks more and get the real deal down the street at Jamba Juice.  I mean, how hard is it to mess up a blended drink? Congratulations McDonald's, you never cease to amaze me....

Review 0: Regular Fast food for our Mcdouble hamburger and Vanilla milk shake. One mistake today.....my vanilla turned chocolate milk shake.


Review 1: Now that I have come clean to the Yelp community about my occasional dabbles with chains I feel it is best to cut right to the quintessential original chain. ...  ... I myself very seldom get anything from McDonald's but I have kids that enjoy their french fries and the wraps they affectionately call "Crap Snacks" ...  ... Additionally my wife is not a coffee drinker and her preferred caffeine delivery method is diet coke.  So the fast food joints not infrequently get the business for the diet cokes. ...  ... The reason this particular McDonald's bears yelping is that it holds a singular record, one that I am at this point hoping it will maintain.  Once a record is set I sometimes loathe to see it fall. ...  ... You see, this particular McDonald's has been visited by myself or members of my immediate family not less than 12 times.  On not one of those occasions have they produced a mistake free order.  Not once.  It's really rather remarkable.  It's not like we routinely order dramatic variations such as "No ketchup" or the dreaded "Can you put Big Mac onions on that?" ...  ... Yet they have steadfastly achieved at least one mistake on each and every order, without exception.   ...  ... On the occasions when we visit this McDonald's we now wait with baited breath while someone checks the bag and confirms that yes, indeed there is something we did not order in the bag or we are missing something we did order or something we ordered is not right.  Please, in the name of all that is Mass Consumerism in America, do not get this order correct!  We have standards!  There are bigger issues at play here!


Review 2: I asked for fresh fries and it took 10 mins to get them. The manager was leaving and had to go in and remind them to bring them. They weren't hot so I called in and they said they would send me a gift card, I've yet to receive it.


Review 3: I've been here three times and every time there was something wrong with my order. FIRST off they put TRASH inside my ice cream... I've gotten used napkins, half my order, half filled drinks, and when I ordered a chocolate dipped ice cream cone there was something sharp sticking out... This place is totally disgusting and every time I brought my order back they acted like I was a bother and that always happens...


Review 4: It's been 2 1/2 years since I posted my original review and this McDonald's still sucks!  We have learned to drive to the McDonald's on Alma School near Ocotillo as it has much better food and service.


Review 5: This has got to be the WORST McDonald's ever.  I have lived less than a mile from it for 4 years.  I am not big on McDonald's, but my kids are.  I have learned to drive miles out of my way to go to another McDonald's. ...  ... Inevitably, though, out of laziness or maybe hope, I keep trying this McDonald's only to have the order screwed up or something to be wrong with the food (stale french fry grease anyone?)  or both.   ...  ... Nothing like the look of disappointment on a child's face when their french frys taste of stale grease.   ...  ... I am not sure if this is a franchise store or corporate owned, but it has consistently been TERRIBLE for FOUR YEARS. ...  ... This McDonald's just needs to be NUKED from orbit.

Review 0: It's Mc Donalds!! I can lay in bed, check in and write a review. Literally, it is that close!! Ha Ha! Much like the reviews people leave for Denny's and other lower end eating facilities that make them sound like they are supposed to be 4 star, this isnt going to happen with me. Its fries, shakes and imitation burgers - I lived in Napa, I know the difference now!  ...  ... So yes, its newer. Its almost always busy, the next closest drive thru Mc Donalds is up the road - oh, and they are building a new one at Reems and Greenway.


Review 1: I don't know if I'm just being pretentious but why do we expect so little from fast food restaurants, anymore I can't feed myself in a drive thru for less than $7-8 which would buy me a much more appetizing lunch at some other restaurants  ...  ... I find that no matter what this location always misses something on my order, If I'm lucky they just short me the condiments that they asked me if I wanted over the speaker, otherwise they will just give me the wrong order or neglect to put sandwiches in the bags, usually our exchanges are silent, because have a nice day or thank you would be borderline on some form of customer service. it just worries me that if this is this nations next great generation that will be entering the workplace in a few years that can't even say thank you or have a nice day when they thrust an overpriced quarter pounder and fries through the window what do my fellow generation Y,X er's have to look forward to in the coming years. ...  ... I guess my biggest point of conflict is the use of the "Double Checked for Accuracy" stickers that McDonald's started using to seal the bags, which apparently someone at corporate thought paradoxical stickers that create the illusion of quality is better than actually fulfilling the prophecy, personally I would feel better if they said " Half-Assed and Over Priced" preferably with smiley face too.


Review 2: Not a fan of this store.


Review 3: The food is exactly the same as any other McD's, so what I'm rating is the service. It's not great!  ...  ... My number 1 pet peeve at a drive through is when you pull up & sit there without being acknowledged for what seems like an ETERNITY. Is it really that hard to say, "I'll be with you in a moment"? Apparently at this establishment it is. ...  ... The other thing this particular restaurant has done quite often is get some part of my order wrong. I ask for Dr. Pepper, I get Coke. It's little stuff, but still not what I asked & paid for.


Review 4: This is the closest McDonalds by my house so out of convenience we go here most of the time.  It always feels like the fries are old.  And McDonalds fries are my favorite, so it kills me that the ones at the McDonalds are so bad.  I hope they improve, but if they did then I would just be compelled to eat there more often.  Maybe they are actually doing me a favor by not making their fries too delicious?


Review 5: DO NOT DRIVE AWAY WITHOUT CHECKING YOUR ORDER!!  And the reason  why I'm yelling is so you don't miss this lol. This place is terrible. Horrible management; staff is very inexperienced; food is 3 out of 10; "pull up and we will bring you the food" 20 minutes later.  Get the drift ?!?This place is no good.


Review 6: I eat at McDonalds....I grew up on happy meals :)  Every so often I feel like having the Mcdonald fries(when I am having my cheat meal). ...  ... In review of this Mcdonalds I sometimes avoid this one and go to another so I can enjoy my fries and food!  This is the closest one to my house, but when I have a McDonalds craving I would like to have "good" McDonalds.   ... I want salty, lightly greased fries, this McDonalds always lacks salt, dry fries, and most of the time they are give me luke warm fries.  By the time I get home, the fries are cold?  I live within a mile of this one!  If you are looking to enjoy some McDonalds fries this McDonalds never seems to get the taste right and I avoid it when I get that craving..... If you want salt less fries, cold buns on your burger visit this McDonalds.


Review 7: I made this account just so I could do a review on this place. ...  ... Ok giving this Mcdonalds 1 star as I will not be going there anymore. ...  ... I just moved to Surprise in Oct. 2012 and so far been to this Mcdonalds 6 times. Out of the 6 times 4 of the orders were wrong. I'm reading other reviews and this stuff has been happening since 2009???? Really? I would think they would get things right. ...  ... So on one of my orders, I order a chicken CBO burger, I get meat. Than on another order I ask for crispy chicken, I get grilled. The 3rd mess up I asked for a Fish sandwich. Let me say this again A FISH SANDWICH, and they give me a meat one again.  Finally today I ask for large fries and drink, they ring me up for large fries but give me medium drink. But not only that, when I first got the drink it wasn't even my drink! They were handing me food from the person behind me. They didn't even ask if this is what I order. ...  ...  Never have I been to a fast food place that messes up orders this much. It's a joke of a place. They can't say "well other fast food places do this". No they don't! Not even other McDonalds do this! Maybe it's someone telling me to stop eating fast food when I'm too lazy to cook hahaha. But in any case I'm done going to this one. ...  ... Edit: Oh and like someone else said, their fries have been super bad all 6 times I have gone there. They are never hot, only slightly warm and no salt at all on them.


Review 8: Not a great experience.... lobby area was not filled. Had to wait for lids. Food was below par. People were streaming in from drive thru to correct orders of missing and wrong food. Inappropriate language from counter workers during a slow period. Manager was standing right there next to them and seemed to have no problems with their behavior.


Review 9: One its a McDonalds and two  its a McDonalds.  There is two places to order in the drive thru but for some reason the drive through allays has a huge wait.


Review 10: The prices are going up and quality is sliding. I thought McCafe would help bring competitive prices to the industry but unfortunately are on par with Starbucks.


Review 11: Wish I could give this place NO STARS! They continue to drop the ball on customer service and food quality. I mean you can't expect much from McDonald's period these days but GEEZE! This place is a joke! They manage to mess up the simplest orders and then proceed to give as much attitude as possible when correcting any issue. This location needs to go back to the drawing board! Send the whole staff back to McDonald's university so they can be retrained on EVERYTHING!!! If you are tempted to stop here think twice and if it's not too far go to the McDonalds inside of Walmart at El Mirage and Thunderbird it's much better.


Review 12: You know that gross taste way too old iced tea has ??? Well that is what i got from here. I know if that happens they aren't fallowing their labeling and dumping the old stuff rules. Most McDonald's don't have that problem. Also the hubby ordered an iced coffee and it had like 5 ice cubes, warm iced coffee yuck !!

Review 0: Completely remodeled.  HUGE improvement.  My kids call it "old people McDonald's". ...  ... No play area.


Review 1: Recently remodeled! Looks and feels modern with great new dining room lay out. Of course still one of the better McDonald's in the Surprise/Sun City area.


Review 2: I only go here for some sweet tea.


Review 3: Doesn't have a playplace for kids. Very dissapointed.


Review 4: I don't believe this place !!! If it was privately owned as a single restaurant it would have gone bust within 6 months. You have to be a certified idiot to get a job here. You try to give your order to an imbecile who has not got past the 3rd grade, and works the cash register also. After 3-4 tries she finally has your order right. After a 15-20 minute wait, your single cup of decaf comes up, right? Hell no. It all comes out of the same pot, the pot without the orange decaf band. There were two cups up at the same time, when i asked which one was the decaf and the coffee, the smart alec said "take your pick, we only have regular rright now" This is the worst experience at a McDonalds i have ever had and i am not alone, at least 4 customers were complaining about there order not being right. Never again!!!!!  Mcdonalds, get a grip and check this place out.


Review 5: I should know better.  I know. ...  ... McDonald's generally wouldn't get more than a three for average service, but you know sometimes you get that craving and for me, I hadn't had it in a loooong time.  Long and tiring day at work sometimes needs to be offered a little unhealthy nostalgic fast food. ...  ... It's even worse when McDonald's employees don't even care to be there.  Seriously, how hard is it to put together a burger? ...  ... My BigMac came without a piece of meat and without cheese.  When I pointed out their error, the employee giggled and shrugged her shoulders and handed me another one moments later. ...  ... Dumb. ...  ... Then they had a huge banner that said "Happy People Day" or some wierdness...signed by employees.  When I asked what it was about, they didn't even know. ...  ... Duuumb.  You have a huge banner celebrating something that you're not even sure the reason for?


Review 6: If zero stars we're possible, oh would I ever. Not only did they screw up what I ordered, they couldn't even take responsibility.


Review 7: This location sucks... They cant get simple orders correct. I only get coffee or ice cream from mcdonalds,  I don't like the food at all.


Review 8: This may be the worst McDonalds in Arizona.  Poorly designed facility makes it almost impossible to access soft drinks and condiments.  To top it off, the food is usually stale or cold.


Review 9: Very terrible service. People have screwed up EVERY order i've made. Three times they've handed me a drink that opened and spilled all over my door in the drive thru after I've asked them to make sure it was secure. Once I waited for 25 minutes for 10 cheese burgers I was taking to a group of people who were helping me at an event. ...  ... I've asked them specifically not to put things on my food and still they do. I told the girl I was deathly allergic to pickles (not true, but told her this so to make sure they were not on the burger) and yet my burger still had pickles. ...  ... Luckily this McD's has made me not want fast food anymore. If I go to McD's I get a parfeit or oatmeal.


Review 10: What a joke. No counter person at all. They just looked at me while I stood there. Hey Isaiah, stop flirting with your female burger flipping coworker and do your job?  No professionalism at all. A bunch of damned morons to tell you the truth. I will avoid this place in the future. I walked out I was so mad.

Review 0: This place is actually a new fancy Mc Cafe. Inside looks like a starbucks with wood finishes, pendant lights and wood flooring. VERY NICE for a McDonalds. We just ventured in for a Free Mc Flurry. So, there may be just a little bias on this one. We won coupons at the ballgame. They were, of course, delicious, and the price was right!!!!


Review 1: The playground here is a lot of fun.  We came here on our way up to Flagstaff and the kiddo loved the playground!  I liked it, too, because you didn't have to do a whole lot of crawling trying to get to your kid.   ...  ... We had breakfast there and food was par with other McD's.  Good service, too, probably better than average of other McD's I've been to.


Review 2: Chicken wings.  When we asked if they were regular or spicy we were told regular.   Wrong!   They have a kick.  IMHO. If you are going to do a national roll out on the product, you should test your employee's knowledge before putting them on the register. ...  ...   The store we went to didn't even have signage up.  We had to ask If that location had the wings.   Now before you tell me they are just teens,  this was lunch time, in a senior community, during a school day, and the person who waited on us was mid to late 20s. ...  ... The wings are pre cooked, spicy, and a lot of breading.


Review 3: Food was ok WiFi was great thank again


Review 4: What can I say, it's mcdonalds. The kids love coming here and playing in the play place.


Review 5: Wow, new interior with contemporary seats & WiFi, yet mostly old farts as patrons enjoying their Egg McMuffins 'n Coffee.  Decent parking.  Nice vibe.  I got to see one guy spew profanities at the manager for a problem with his order.  Oh well.


Review 6: Maybe its new, but it sure is on the slow side?  Maybe I got a bad crew day.  The employees sure were unfriendly and seriously 1 napkin for 3 meals?  1 sauce for 10 nuggets?  I had to keep asking for stuff.  Maybe more fast food places like this will make me not want to eat fast food.


Review 7: Why bother to ask what kind of sauce I want for nuggets at the time of order if you aren't going to add them to my bag at the drive-thru window. Not just isolated either, its EVERY time.  I always have to remind them about the sauces even though its on my order ticket.  I can't even remember a time when they got my order 100% correct.  Took my son there today.  Time was around 2pm so not busy at all.  Went through the drive thru.  Ordered a mighty kids meal for a BOY and when asked what kind of sauce for his nuggets I specified sweet n sour.  Also ordered a #1 combo with diet coke.  Think thats a pretty simple and straight foward order right? Well of course I get to the window and no sauce in the bag so I ask for the girl for some sauce.  Hand my son his mighty meal and he freaks out because they gave him a princess toy!  This is not good!  So I have to now park and go inside just to swap the darn toy!  I sure hope that management reads these reviews so they can make the changes needed.


Review 8: Awful. 6 times in 6 visits and every order incorrect. Maddening. The last was a quarter pounder with cheese where they forgot.....the cheese.....there's just no excuse. 6 times is just too much of a coincidence which leads me to believe that the workers here are neglectful, forgetful and Just don't give a fig. I'm done with you guys and MacDonald's, period.


Review 9: Dumb dumb DUMB. Shame on me. I went back here again after I swore I wouldn't. Ordered a #4 combo - that's 2 cheeseburgers - plus diet coke, at the drivethru. Get my order and reach in the bag to feel around. I can feel a frickin BOX in there. Lo and behold, they've given me a single filet-o-fish in the bag!! Back home I take a sip of the diet coke, and stop dead. Give it to my wife. She confirms. It's regular coke. IDIOTS! This place should be shut down, it's the absolute worst McDonalds I have EVER experienced. INCREDIBLY annoyed, enough to write in to the head office.


Review 10: Go to Taco Bell across the way. This place sucks. Rude and can't get food right or even hot. They can even keep the play area clean and they weren't that busy.


Review 11: How hard is to keep track of a small fry and smoothie? They have yet to get my or my parent's order right at this location. It would seem that management is lacking as everyone is standing around trying to figure out what they should be doing.


Review 12: I am very disappointed in three McDonalds stores in Surprise Az.   We have visited the bell and 303 location 2 times, and the Walmart @ Waddell rd 2 times and the Grand and. Reems location 1 time,  since Thanksgiving ordered the XBOX promo, and each time I had to ask for XBOX game pieces, they employees did not have the right containers out to play the game.    Early on in the game I guess I understood, but not weeks into the game.  These stores need to be made aware of what is going on and the stores managers and assistant managers need to be more attentive.


Review 13: I've eaten at a LOT of McDonalds' in multiple countries but this place is the WORST when it comes to quality. My wife takes the pickles off her burgers and when she recently opened up a southwest chicken sandwich there was what appeared to be LINT on the bottom of it! We were busy that evening, kept it in the fridge to take back, didn't have time the next day and then it obviously didn't matter.. I've bought filet-o-fishes where the tartar sauce is slopped so far on the side of the sandwich that most of it winds up in the box, and a couple of nights ago we gave them one last chance - wife brought back my order of 2 filet-o-fishes and I looked in the bag and asked why they'd given us chicken sandwiches? She checked inside and said they were just the wrong box but the f-o-f's were correct. Fair enough. Then she had another look in the fucking bag and found they'd given her a spicy chicken sandwich instead of a double cheeseburger. WTF? I mean obviously she checks the bag when they pass it into the vehicle window but when you see the correct number of boxes/items in a darkened car interior you assume you're good to go, right? You're not going to check between the damn burger's legs to determine its gender, right? Basically this place SUCKS, the franchise owner has no clue about quality control and we're not eating there again. I'll see if I can find the pic of the lint on the burger that she sent me from her Blackberry. Avoid this place and just get Culvers or Jack in the Box instead. ...  ... Incidentally, this is the first McDonalds in over thirty years that I've had anything near this sort of tragic experience with, which is mainly the reason we went back after we got the lintburger..


Review 14: Tried the clubhouse burger.  YUCK,  the flavors don't blend, the bun tasted weird, too much sauce that was not complimentary to the sandwich, long story short didn't like.  Gave it a thumbs down to manager, who seemed un interested when I told her that we ate only a third of the sandwiches we purchased.


Review 15: What can I say! The changes! McDonalds has been around forever! And now they want to change! Just because a few people wants to run our lives!! I get it! You can always make it an option! But no! You have to request fries! or soda! If I want a freakin apple or milk, I'll just eat at home! We come to the golden arches to get away from everyday life. Give me that processed food! That's why we come here for!!! Anyway, this location is like any other place. Good service, at least they try! You have to realize that if these workers were more valuable, they would be working somewhere else! Give these kids a break. We have all been there!

Review 0: I know a lot people don't like McD's, but this one is actually pretty good.  Every time I have gone there, they get my order correct and pretty good service.  If you have Sun Dollars from ASU you can use them there.  It's cheap food and the parfaits are good for only a buck.  The bathrooms are always clean and they remodeled the inside so it looks really nice.  They even have a waterfall inside.  It's probably the nicest McDonald's in Tempe.


Review 1: I had their cheddar and grilled onion burger.  It wasn't bad...


Review 2: It was time to try the McWrap. All the commercials got to me and it does come in cool packaging. It is like a burrito nest they lay the McWrap inside, but it doesn't look exactly like the commercials portray the thing. Nothing is sticking out of the wrap like fresh cucumbers, etc. It wasn't bad though. It was the sweet-chili version and the chicken strips were grilled and there was some veggies and a  splash of slightly spicy, but sweet sauce. At $4.50, it was only about 375 calories, so if you have no choice and need to eat healthy, the McWrap does the trick.


Review 3: The usually get stuff wrong, but are quick to fix it. Cater to the drive thru customers so you might have to wait a while if you go in to order. Inside is generally clean,  bathrooms are not the worst. They have catsup and straws and napkins available for self service. There are many different seating options and they're open late inside the dining area.


Review 4: This location was one of the worst experiences I've had at McDonalds in a while. The location is older and you can tell the lot needs to be repaved. The drive thru was extremely slow. Add to it that the location is really inconvenient, and this made for a poor experience


Review 5: Everyone on the planet darn near has visited McDonald's. It's worldly icon and it will probably be the first form of food to be available on the ISS (International Space Station) which I think is only fitting! However there is a problem that "McD's" needs to fix before "they boldly go where no burger has gone before." McD's management at the store level and at the corporate level need to train their employees on how to get an order correct when it comes to what the customer says they want. Now I'm not saying don't up sell apple pies and drinks but the people who work in drive through and in-store need to really listen to the customer and hear what they want!  ...  ... When I go to McD's drive thru or in-store I like to order a "Quarter Pounder" an original "core" sandwich at McD's. The Quarter Pounder was invented in 1971. When I place my order the employee always ask me do I want cheese on it? I say no and they turn and tell the cook "One Quarter Ham" please. Now I have learned over the years of ordering at McD's how to order to get exactly what I want, so I figured I would say what the order taker would say to the cook to get what I wanted. Sounds pretty simple to me...Not so fast! The order taker still ask me if I wanted cheese on my burger. ...  ... So when I return another time and I order my Quarter Pounder I say "may I have a Quarter Ham please" and what does the employee do? Ask me if I want cheese!!! I say no again! Then they turn around and say "One Quarter Ham!" What's up with that? I ask for for a burger in McDonald's employee terminology and the employee disregards the terminology and hears only what they want to hear. ...  ... Then to top things off they want to charge me the same price for a Qtr Ham as a Qtr Ham with cheese which makes no sense to me! So when I inquire about the differences in prices or lack there of, the employees tell me that they must charge me the same price for a "Quarter Ham" as a "Quarter Pounder with Cheese" there is no pricing difference. Why not??? (Considering a regular hamburger cost one price and their regular cheeseburger cost is a little more because of the cheese being added.) By me not adding cheese to my sandwich the employee has to do more keystrokes than the single one touch entry for a Quarter Pounder with cheese! More work= more time in line for the employee and the customer. ...  ... I know I'm crazy for blogging about this but if nothing is said people will not get what they want when they go to McD's and that's not right and I really do enjoy the food there. I have been going since I was a little kid with my father and brother and it was a weekly treat and I have done the same with my son some 30+ years later. What your training your employees to do is not good customer service this is cattle herding!!! The days of customer service have all but dissolved away and as a corporate entity you know this and instead of going back to what got you where you are today you change your own corporate model and do business as usual!!! ...  ... On a side note! if your going to put someone in drive-thru, put someone there who speaks intelligable english. I could barely understand the girl working in the drive-thru and I also speak spanish and when I realised it would be better to talk to her in spanish she dismissed my ability to order in spanish and used English but when I'm in the store (same transaction because something was wrong with my order) I heard someone make their order in spanish and she spoke it back to the customer for the whole transaction! Can a brotha that speaks spanish not be slightly discriminated against because I don't look like I come from a spanish speaking country???


Review 6: I wish I could give this place 0 stars because 1 star is too generous. Two of the worst experiences I've had at a restaurant have been at this McDonald's in the past two days. Last night the guy told me he was done playing my game and that they didn't have honey when I asked if they seriously didn't have honey and tonight I had to ask the girl to slide my card because she held it in her hand and proceeded to stick her head out the window and tell someone that she could see their light flashing. I get that it's McDonald's but this specific location is awful and will no longer be receiving my business


Review 7: I've never had a problem with service from the employees or food, as far as McDonald's go that aspect is pretty typical. The problem lays in the terrible people that occupy the lobby for hours on end. This is a place for people to flock with their computers and sit for 8 hours at a time. They leech off of the wi-fi and play their music loudly while they play games. It gets worse when they have breakfast wrappers sitting on their table at 4pm. If you want a seat to enjoy your meal upon, you're out of luck, and the idea of going in groups is directly out of the question unless you want to sit outside by a busy road. Until the management steps up and clears out lobby for the actual customers, i recommend trying the taco bell next door.


Review 8: One thing about this McDonald's is that the decor has been revamped. It's a very nice McDonalds when you look at everything. However, that's as far as it goes. ...  ... Good thing I'm only coming in for something off the value menu but I say you are better off going somewhere else. Or even a different McDonald's. The one on McClintock and University is nice. Go to that one. ...  ... The service at this one by ASU is pretty lousy. I had a person that couldn't even answer my questions. A manager was there to interpret back to the person at the register. And another time, they couldn't even answer what a certain sandwich contains when they DID speak English. I don't know what these people are doing but it's definitely not their job.


Review 9: This location has the WORST service I have ever seen. I mean, I know people make mistakes once or twice, but EVERY time I eat here something goes wrong. I've had food not given to me that I paid for, really terribly cooked food, and order mess-ups all at this location in just the past few times I've been here. Come on, really, you work at a FAST FOOD place. How hard can your job be? The only reason I keep returning here is because its right near my apartments but it looks like from now on I'll be going out of my way to go to the location on University.

Review 0: Can't complain about this location. Drive through is quick and they have never messed up my order.


Review 1: This is a pretty fast location of McDonalds. The location is nice and new, very clean, and they have the 2 lane drive thru setup. The people at the windows were very friendly and courteous and made for a fun experience. Good job, Mickey-D's!!


Review 2: Have been here for breakfast a few times now and the service always seems to be quick and the always has that same delicious mcdonalds taste...The only thing is sometimes the cashier can be rude and short with the orders. Not every welcoming to 2 orders in the car as well. Also, the hash browns seem to be inconsistent. Either overcooked or a bit undercooked. Uh hello!!!This is the best part about mcdonalds breakfast here people!!!!!


Review 3: This is a McDonald's, however in the past couple of months they completely remodeled the whole thing, so now it's worse. You'd think with new decor and freshly opened makes it better, it doesn't. it's cold and cramped, and i don't recommend it at all. The staff looks new, but already they need a new over-haul as well. Crazy.


Review 4: While I am not a frequent McDonalds customer, there are times when I absolutely, positively have to have the fries.  Nothing else will do.  When that need strikes this clean and newly renovated McDonalds location is A-OK! ...  ... Two drive-through lanes make ordering and receiving food quick and easy.  I fortunately have not had the experience of receiving an incorrect order, and have even been able to use coupons in the drive-through without issue.   ...  ... While the food never quite looks as it appears on TV, I have not been to a McDonalds that does meet this standard (except in Tokyo, which made the most beautiful Big Mac I have ever seen... ) So, this will continue to be my go-to spot to satisfy my fry cravings.


Review 5: About 99% of the time I don't eat fast food. However,  on the weekends we occasionally get egg mcmuffin meals that are pretty tasty.  They certainly are still fast food,  and don't compare to restaurant style food,  but sometimes a lil mcdonalds hits the spot.  I love their hash browns.


Review 6: I'm reviewing yet another fast food restaurant and it's not because I'm totally into grease, but because I'm admittedly overly critical of attention to detail in these drive-thru places because hello, you're driving through, usually driving AWAY, and you're too far from the restaurant to remedy the situation when you notice they foul up. I worked at a restaurant with a drive-thru when I was in high school that was run by a tough, whip-wielding family who taught us that you DON'T make mistakes. You just don't. You take steps to ensure that you are not missing anything because no one wants to drive back to bitch when mistakes are made.  ...  ... With that said... not only was a special order acknowledged but not followed through, we received no ketchup (for not one but two orders of french fries), no STRAW for a soda, and they charged me an extra 27 cents for a side of sweet and sour. Which they didn't put in the bag. Now while I realize that these are minor items and to some I may be perceived as a petty crank with too much time on my hands, if this is the way you need to drink your soda while you drive, with a straw, it complicates things. If you like ketchup with your fries and at 99% of every other drive-thru in the country you don't have to ask for it, you're in for an unpleasant surprise. And paying extra for something you don't receive is really dumb.  ...  ... Onto the food...  ... I remember back when I was a young whipper-snapper, that McRib was awesome (as long as you don't lift the bun and look at it, you're golden). While it hasn't shrank like everything else it seems, they now skimp on the sauce in a big way, and let's face it, it's the sauce that makes the sandwich. This sucks: The poor old smooshed-together McRib just isn't that great anymore. Or maybe my cranky, wrinkled-up ornery taste buds have changed. Or maybe I've finally woken up and realized that no one should ever be eating this kind of food, for any reason whatsoever.  ... I'm sure it's a combination of the three.


Review 7: I've been to this Micky D's a few times and each time I've been here it's been okay...this time, however, I came with a co-worker to get lunch for our boss. They screwed the order up each time they repeated it and gave us two Coke Zeros instead of one Coke Zero and one Dr. Pepper as ordered...even then, my co-worker said the DP tasted flat and nasty.  ...  ... The drive-through people here this time were rather snarky and didn't crack a smile. They had a very rude tone with a straight-faced, pissed expression. I've worked in the food business in the past and that is VERY BAD ETIQUETTE! Not cool, McD's! Get some people who appreciate helping customers and get rid of these ass clowns you  have working for you! These reasons are why my opinion from former visits went from pretty good to downhill and less of star ratings. ...  ... By the way, clowns are CREEPY! Ronald McDonald has ALWAYS creeped me out since childhood!


Review 8: This place has gone to pots since they have changed over to the new improved look they seem to get my orders wrong every time the food is cold and just doesn't taste like Mcdonalds food. The drive thru menu is hard to read since they changed the background to white and if you go at night prepare yourself for extremely rude employees and just over all bad service. I have been attending this location since humm I was born.. I had my birthday parties there in the 70's and 80's.. now its just not the same.. I really just have to say the food does not taste the same as it did before they changed it over to the new improved look. Although I love the look maybe its the coldness of the employees whom you can tell really don't want to work there but they have too. NEEDS EMPLOYEE Training there on how to be kind and smile


Review 9: I received the worst service ever tonight nothing like a moody shift manager with a attitude.NOT A GOOD LOOK FOR YOU MCDONALD'S


Review 10: Not only is this a McDonald's so therefore nigh on inedible, but its a bad McDonalds! I have never had food from here that tasted good at all! ...  ... Two pet peeves: They have no bike rack. Y'know how Mickey D's is all, "We are for the active American now, come get yer carrot sticks!" Well, why don't you have a bike rack? Especially in one of the highest bike population densities in the country? Burger King down the block has 'em! ...  ... The other: They have done away with small drinks. The smallest is medium now. THE SMALLEST DRINK IS A MEDIUM. Even better? They still have lids labeled for smalls!


Review 11: Terrible customer service. Opened 24hrs yet they can't make coffee or give you old sandwiches. Half the time it's "cash" ... Only. I hate coming here.


Review 12: While placing my order through the DRIVE THRU she asked "is that for here or to go?"


Review 13: You couldn't screw up my order any more if you tried.  This place is so bad I just pull up to the drive through and I tell them, "I have $15.00 to feed 4 people. Make it happen."  That is the only way I can be sure that they won't give me the wrong thing.

Review 0: I've been to this McDonald's twice now and the service is fast, friendly, and fantastic! Their employees are very helpful and make sure your order is complete and correct before they hand it over to you.  ...  ... I recommend giving this location a try if you haven't yet. The experience is well worth it!


Review 1: Slowest.... McDonald's..... Ever.... With two drive-thru you would think that this would go a lot faster. I'm very rational about waiting, but what bothers me the most is a type of customer service. Better training is needed. Otherwise great design.


Review 2: Go to this McDonalds just cause its next to work.  Service is slow...  everyone seems like they don't want to work there.  Even the supervisor doesn't even want to take orders.  Hashbrown taste like a filot fish.  Even drive-thru takes forever.


Review 3: I've been to this location 3 different times and ordered 2 double cheeseburgers all 3 times and it was beyond terrible. Cold patties, cheese not melted, carelessly thrown together burgers, fries taste like they have been sitting for days. McDonald's is never expected to be the caviar of food but I would at least expect some sort of quality. If there was an option for 1/2 of a star I would do it.


Review 4: This McDonalds has very poor service. The employees seemed like they did not want to work there at all. Food sometimes takes quite some time to come out. I go here since it is right next to work and is very close. Other coworkers also complain about this McDonalds not being that great and recommended me to actually go out of my way to a different place to get breakfast.

Review 0: Has got to be the worse mcdonalds I have ever been too. I thought all the other reviews were just being mean, but they're right. I walked in at 1:20pm on a Thursday. There was one family waiting for ice cream cones but other than that, no one else was in line or near the counter. I watched as the cashier got the ice cream cones made and handed to the kids and even when she looked at me and I smiled at her, she still did not return the smile or greet me. There was another worker bagging drive thru food and another employee sweeping the floor. All of them looked directly at me. Not one of them greeted.  ... I waited for 10 minutes WITH NO ONE ELSE IN LINE before I finally was asked what I wanted. They were all talking to each other and joking around with the cooks about nonsense.  ... I finally got my drink, the soda was flat, and when I got my food, the buns were stale and the fried were old and cold.  ... The seats were falling apart. The booth I sat in moved every time the teen on the other side of it moved. They then made it a game and continued to move it and laugh about it with their friends. One woman sat in another booth next to mine and the seat nearly collapsed to the ground because of how unstable it was.  ... I was just looking for cheap dollar menu before work but this wasn't even worth the dollar.


Review 1: I started this review with two stars, but I'm editing it to give it only one. By the time I get to the register it's 10:30 and I am told I can't order breakfast even though I was in line before 10:30. The cashier let me order breakfast anyway - all I want is a McMuffin - and I proceed to wait twenty minutes to even get my order. I might have been able to forgive this considering there were two huge orders ahead of mine (Easter breakfast for the whole family, I guess) except my McMuffin was soggy, and my iced coffee was so stale I couldn't taste the flavored syrup in it. Worst of all, even after I got my food, I still had to wait for my coffee, because they had decided to make coffee for other orders first. You can be sure I will do my very best to never come here again.


Review 2: They don't have the combo with two sausage egg mcmuffins. I wake up, on Easter, go and think I'll have a delightful fast food breakfast, drive around in an unfamiliar city, finally make it to those golden arches and into the drive thru and what do I get? My dreams crushed. My soul shattered. Needless to say if I'm in Phoenix again I will NOT be coming here for nourishment.


Review 3: This has to be one of the worst McDonalds I have ever been to they are extremely slow even during the middle of the night, after midnight they seem to never be able to do any transactions other than debit card and most not all of the staff are rude.  I keep going hoping that maybe they mad some type of miraculous change in staff and pace but of course I am always let down.... I am typing this as I wait for my chicken nuggets


Review 4: This is one of the worst McDonald's locations I have ever been to. It's always bad and doesn't matter what time or day they consistently disappoint.

Review 0: This is McDonald's, you know what to expect and they deliver it consistently. If you're writing a bad review about McDonald's, you may lack self control or are just a cranky person. McDonald's is a great place to indulge in unbelievable french fries and tiny wonderful cheeseburgers, but only a few times a year.


Review 1: This place is brand new!  So you know McDonalds is on it's game for the first year.  The food has been great every time, and the employees there actually have made me laugh a couple of times through the drive through.  They seem very nice and not always... Can I take your oder... I give this place 5 stars as far as mcdonalds go.  I drive a little out of my way to come to this one because I know all their machines are nice, clean and new ^.^


Review 2: I'm here frequently for coffee since it's close to my kids school. We've had fundraisers here, playdates, etc. Plenty of room. Dining room is remodeled. Video games and a large play structure for the kids. The food is ya know McDonald's, but the employees are friendly and they get my order correct pretty much all the time (they can't seem to grasp light cream on the iced coffee though). Bathrooms are clean. No complaints :)


Review 3: Mcdonald's food is just way to constant to judge it from location,  so you can really only review the service.   This location is better than many I've been to,  and the ground up rebuild a few month ago makes it one of the more modern Mickey D's arround.   Only thing that keeps this from being a 5 star review was the fact that they don't open at 4:30am.  Now,  I can't nessesarraly fault them for that,  but a few weeks ago I tried to go through the drive through at 4:30am or thereabouts.  ALL the lights  at the drive through and through out the store were on,  so I sat there for a few minutes saying "hello"  before driving off.   Overall,  decent coffee,  good fast food and service. Of course I'll be back!


Review 4: Solid mcdonalds, good coffee, fresh , accurate orders. Free wifi and a remodeled dining room.


Review 5: Usually here for the occasional diet Coke and occasionally an ice cream cone for the dogs, but since sometime around 7:00 a.m. this morning the place is gone -completely demolished.  Now why does that make me all happy and giddy with joy?  I imagine it's simply because it's too much of a temptation. ... Well I don't know this to be a fact but I'm fairly certain they'll be back.

Review 0: I stop at this McD's sometimes for breakfast when Im in a hurry and they always impress me!  The service is always fast (I always use the drive-through) and my food has been hot and fresh every time. ... Ive not been inside, so I cant speak for that aspect, but the service and food quality is above average in my opinion for McDonalds. ...  ... Not sure what that other review is all about... I mean really, who drives 15 mins to a late night McD's for a coke (and doesnt immediately taste it when the get it! LOL)...??


Review 1: I stopped by this McDonalds yesterday before work. I knew I wanted some nuggets and maybe fries. I got to the window and ordered nuggets. I wanted a second to decide if I wanted the full meal or anything else but the girl in the drive thru rushed me so I decided not to get anything other than the nuggets. I know it's "fast" food and ideally I should come through the drive thru and already know what I want to buy, but I wasn't going to spend more than 2 minutes looking at the menu and deciding. It wasn't even busy, there was no one behind me and this location has two speakers. Even when I went to pay she was in too much of a hurry and practically threw my change at me. I won't go out of my way to come here again. I ended up going to Burger King for a whopper and fries a few hours later. If  the girl at the window had been a little more patient then I probably would have just gotten a full meal and drink from McDonalds. ...  ... 2 Stars because the girl at the second window was nice and the nuggets weren't bad.


Review 2: I got a bunch of breakfast food and basically the whole order was wrong. There was sausage seeping through the bag and they added 3 things we didn't even order and forgot 2 sandwiches we ordered. The food looked absolutely disgusting. The eggs look like a big pile of thick mustard the sausages were dripping so much with oil it was seeping through the bag. The lady even asked us if we needed extra syrup and hot sauce and she didn't even put them in the bag...wtf? I have two young children who were very disappointed when we couldn't eat the food because it was just disgusting. And when I called them and asked for a manager she answered the phone and said you're speaking to one in a very very rude tone. And then I started telling her what was wrong she said bring it all back and we will redo the order....well no I have two young kids I don't have a car I can't be going back-and-forth it's just not logical for me then she interrupted me and rudely said what what's missing from your order I couldn't even believe how I was being treated so I just hung up the phone I will never go to this McDonald's again and I'll make sure every single person that I know doesn't go to this McDonald's either.  Timestamp 10 AM May 20, 2014


Review 3: I managed to convince myself to drive the 15 minutes to this Mcdonalds, as it was one of few open at 1 am.  I ordered a coke, drove home (30 min round trip plus wait in line) and discovered to my dismay that I had been given a Dr. Pepper. I hate Dr. Pepper, threw it away.  This is not the first time I have been disappointed in this store.  On several occasions on late night visits they have not been able to accept debit.  Another time I received diet coke.  The next time I feel like a late night snack Im going to Wendys.


Review 4: Stopped in to buy a couple bags of ice.   Counter person said they didn't have any. Spoke with a manager who said sometimes they have it and sometimes they don't.  No one wanted to bag any.

Review 0: I got the mocha chocolate chip frape mmmm sooooo good made my day un till i got stuck in the play house lol just kidding


Review 1: This is a good McDonald's in the Tempe area.  They have good customer service and never have gotten my order wrong.  This is a place that usually busy with families (in Playland) and small crowds.  There is a highschool nearby, so i would be careful not to go during thier lunch hour if you dont want to run into crowds.  The only drawback I think is having to have a code to go into the bathroom :P.  I seen the code before on the reciept you would get at the register, but I dont see that anymore.


Review 2: Good place to go for cheap food, great location, especially in the Tempe area.  Fast and friendly service.


Review 3: I am so thankful there is 24 hr places around town in case you want something at your convienence!


Review 4: Correction - wrong location. I was looking for the location at Elliot and McClintock and reviewed this one. Music is still too loud but I am over 60 and I know every song.  ...  ... Somehow complaining about the food quality at a McDonalds seems disingenuous. It is consistent and filling but not expected to be great cuisine. My issue with this location is the rebuild that now caters to a target market that clearly does not include me anymore. All hard uninviting surfaces and loud music. When I asked if they could just turn the music down the manager said he did not know how???  When you build a place that serves cheap food, has loud music and looks like it was designed by  a skate park builder you should not be surprised when you get skaters and teenagers  to come in. ...  ... Staff always seems to be accommodating if not well informed.


Review 5: Ok, here we go again.  You wash your hands, but they only have those stupid air blowers that take forever to try & dry them, so you go for ass gaskets instead.  There is a dispenser but it's empty, so you spend a while back at the air blower.  Then you go (with your still damp hands) for toilet paper to open the door with, because it has a latch & you'd like to leave the bathroom with you hands cleaner than when you entered!  So far we're at 1 Star     :-O ...  ... The service & food were ok, but I won't return to this McDonalds. ...  ... McRib Combo $4.89, Ice Cream Cone $.79


Review 6: Security guard has something against teenage skaters.  ... The majority of whom were Latino and she told them at the top of her lungs "go to Taco Bell if you want" while pushing them out the door.  ...  ... She let everyone know exactly what she thought of them too. Shouting, instead of talking to customers or other staff "you know skaters" hardy har har.  ...  ... I know they probably did bug her at some point, but my God they are kids, they bug everyone, you just get on with it? ...  ... She was unprofessional and let everyone know it, and not to mention racist with a remark like "go to Taco Bell if you want" to a bunch of Latino teenagers.  ...  ... I know MacDonald's isn't an "outstanding" place to eat. But shut up and let me get on with it without listening to you shout at a bunch of bored teenagers.  ...  ... The food is what it is lol


Review 7: So, on most weekends, I get stuck working late.  Real late.  Most of the time I need to eat before I get home.  That is when I rely on the 24 hour fast food joints.  As much as I try to avoid them, but with my situation, they do come into play. ...  ... This McDonalds is no better or worse than any other as far as the food is concerned.  Crap.  At that late, I face the reaper and need to admit this and go into it willingly.  But this one is across the street from my house, easy to get to on my drive home.  Driving through at about 3 in the morning, and having to wait for 12 minutes for the car in front of me, here is the transcript of my ordering experience. ...  ... drive thru - "Hello, what can I make for you?" ... Me - "Do you have the 20 piece mcnuggets for five dollars?" ... drive thru - "No sir." ... Me - "Oh, you have a huge promo poster I am looking at that says you do, in front of your store." ... drive thru - "No, sir, it is not 5 dollars, it is $4.99, not 5 dollars." ... Me - "Sure, that sounds good.  I'll have that." ... drive thru - "It is not 5 dollars, it is $4.99." ... Me - "Yeah, that is fine, I'll take one order of those." ... drive thru - "The price is different, you want to order them?" ...  ... At this point, I have been up for over 21 hours, working 2 jobs for about 16 of those.  I'm doing my best not to lose my shit. ...  ... Me - "Yes that is fine." ... drive thru - "Sauce?" ... Me - "Just ketchup." ... drive thru - "No sauce?" ... Me - "Ketchup is fine." ... drive thru - "Something to drink?" ... Me - "No thanks." ... drive thru - "No drink?" ... Me - "No thanks." ... drive thru - "Fries?" ...  ... I don't answer, I drive to the window. ...  ... I get my food and drive home.  For 20 nuggets, there are 4 packets of ketchup.  No napkins.  The roommate, who we will call "Joe," is still up.  I eat 10 nuggets and am done.  I give the rest to said roommate. ...  ... Apparently, the second box of nuggets have been sitting out longer than the first box, and he spits one out on the floor after taking a bite.  My dog happily eats the remains. ...  ... I'm making sandwiches when I get home from now on.


Review 8: This is a pretty sucky McDonald's.  It was nice to have a McDonald's so close to where I live, but in the time I have been living here, I have experienced at this place: ...  ... --LOOOOONG drive-thru lines that can take 20 minutes or more. ...  ... --egg shell pieces in the McMuffins ...  ... --double charges on my debit card ...  ... The food actually tastes just a bit better than other McDs I've been to, but the issues listed often make it not really worth it.  If it takes you 20 freaking minutes to get your food, it ain't fast--kind of defeats the purpose.  This place is just a facepalm overall and I really can't recommend it.  Maybe you'll be lucky--we haven't been.


Review 9: Cheap!  Cheap!  Beware!  If you order Chicken McNuggets from this McDonald's they will charge you 10 cents for each sauce packet over the alloted quantity.  Either go to another McDonald's where they don't charge, go to another restaurant that values your business and NOT nickel and dime you to death or don't eat!


Review 10: I guess we don't f***ing learn. ...  ... My wife went here this morning to take advantage of their 2 sausage biscuit with egg McMuffin deal for $3.33.  She ordered 2 of them for $6.66 and it turned out to be a devil's deal.  They charged her for 4 McMuffins and gave her only TWO.  This isn't the first time I've been shorted a McMuffin here, but it is the first time I came TWO SHORT and I'm getting pretty cheesed off. ...  ... They always give replacements when you go back and speak to the manager, but how about not having this garbage happen in the first place? ...  ... Down to one star.

Review 0: Always great!  Hot fries to die for


Review 1: It's McDonald's, expect the expected. This location isn't open late. Keep going down to the one next to AZ Mills for late nite McD's.


Review 2: This is a newer McDonald's, which is designed with a more contemporary feel. There's a large indoor playground for your kids too. Service was quite sluggish though. ...  ... Despite the wait, this will be forever in my memory be the first McDonald's where I tried a shamrock shake (Minty creamy sweet delicious!).


Review 3: I am amped that this particular site does not include four dipping sauces for a 20 piece, Chicken McNuggets. The only give 3, and you have to pay for the fourth. Any other McDonald's in the area gives you four without asking. This McDonald's is trying to pull a fast one. So I just want everyone to know how dirty I think this is. ...  Ever since I was a kid when we ordered nuggets we got 4 dipping sauces. That 5 nuggets per sauce. They expect me to try and ration almost 7 nuggets per container? That's unacceptable. I guess I will visit the McClintock or the ASU locations from now on.


Review 4: The past few times I have stopped at this restaurant to use the drive thru; its been backed up to at least 9 cars.  This McDonalds had customers all confused of who was next in line, which unfortunately there was customers trying to cut in from another side of the drive thru. BUT still if McDonalds was having a order that was taking longer then usual, then ask the customers nicely to park to the side so you can move the other cars waiting.  I thought maybe the whole Restaurant was behind but someone parked and went inside to get their food, to come out only 2 minutes later.  Unfortunately I could not do that since I was caught in the middle of the line.  That indicated to me that they were not behind through the whole store, it was just the drive thru that was sucking.  I like this McDonalds, but they need to be aware of their customers outside also. Its unpleasant when you have to deal with other customers trying to act like they been in line the whole time and trying to cut in from a different side of the McDonalds.  Very rude.  Its common knowledge that the mornings and lunch hours are the busiest, put in better procedures or processes to make sure the customer is happy.


Review 5: This McDonald's is okay. I've been to better ones.  ...  ... My friends and I stopped here for breakfast en route to the NASCAR race. We had to wait a few minutes for their food, which was no big deal, so my friend and I found a table while our other friend used the bathroom. When she came back to the table, the look on her face said it all. She informed us NOT to use the bathroom there unless we use the handicap stall. Why? Because some female had started her monthly problem and left evidence of it IN PLAIN SIGHT on top of the disposal receptacle inside the stall plus the toilet was a mess! The bathroom in general looked as if it hadn't been checked or cleaned in quite some time as well, our friend said.  ...  ... I'm sorry, but any place that doesn't take the time to clean up all parts of their place of business won't be getting my business ever again!


Review 6: Horrible customer service. And apparently all the employees have a hard time hearing. I asked for my burger without PICKLES or mustard. But I guess the girl heard no onions or mustard. So I brought it back up and I'm going to assume I talked to the shift manager and she said "well it says no onions that's why you didn't get onions". Obviously that's why I didn't get onions. I'm not stupid. But that's not what I had said.  ... I guess pickles and onions sound the same.  ...  ... This location sucks only because the employees are not friendly and they don't listen. Your job isn't that hard. And if you hate it then do something about it. Don't give someone crappy service because of it.


Review 7: I vow to never step foot into this mcdonald's again.  It is by far, the nastiest McDonald's I have ever visited.   ...  ... We went in today for an after school mcflurry.  The place smelled bad (think vomit) and it was dirty.  The upholstered chairs are in such bad shape that they have been "repaired" with duct tape all along the entire bank of tables.   ...  ... This place gives me the creeps.  So long McDonald's.  I don't think I'll miss you.


Review 8: Please note: I realize this is fast food and I am rating it as such. ...  ... This is what I ordered in the drive-thru and in this order:  1 chocolate milk, 1 small orange juice, 1 large vanilla iced coffee, 6 sausage mcmuffins, 1 large coke.   ... Here is the response I got:  1 large french vanilla iced coffee, anything else? ...  ... It took a few tries but she finally got my order right.  When we picked up the food, the coffee had no flavoring.  Albeit, I was mad at the need to go into the restaurant (we used drive-thru for a reason) but when I got in there the manager said she didn't give me flavoring because of how they wrote the ticket.  She was wearing the drive-thru headset!  When I asked who took my order then, she flat out lied to me and said someone else took it.  It's one thing to get crappy service in a fast food restaurant but when the manager has no honesty or integrity at all, they deserve to go out of business.  I really hope the manager above her sees this.  If a manager can't even be honest to a customer about a simple order, what else is she capable of doing?

Review 0: If you like Mc Donald's food, then this is a very good location. The location is very convenient and has entrances from 2 streets. The parking lot is kind of a pain to navigate but the lot is very clean. The employees at this location are very courteous and seem to be in a better mood than in most Mc Donald's locations. The drive thru here is extremely fast, even though it only has 1 lane going in. Overall, I definitely recommend this location over any of the others in the area. ...  ... Still McDonald's food, though...


Review 1: This is the Wal-ly World of fast food places. Everything processed and genetically engineered. There is a reason it tastes exactly the same no matter which one you go to. Scary. ... I have to give them an extra star, per my own rule, because they do serve Coke Zero. The only reason I was even here was they had free food but even for free the price is too high. I am one who doesn't turn down free food but from Micky Ds I just might. ... The restaurant, for lack of a better term, itself is nice. Clean and efficient. Nice staff. But overall it is still a McDonald's. Satan won't even eat here. Nor are there any McDonald's in hell because the Devil thinks it is cruel and unusual punishment. ... On the plus side there are Unicorns in the ball pit and they serve alcohol upstairs but you have to ask nice and know the secret password. ... I will try my best to never go to a McDonald's again but once in a while they have cheap or free Big Macs which might lure me back for a second or two. It is sad that at the mire mention of the word Big Mac I can almost taste one. Ugh. ... I am sure some people like McDonald's and think it is a good value with fast and friendly service. Everyone is entitled to their opinion. In my opinion though with so many other great choices, some a thousand times better, why still go here. Oh well. Evil exists so we know what good is.


Review 2: If you want to go to a fast food restaurant to be ignored, then this is the place.  The employees go out of there way to ignore anyone who might be in line.  Only when there is a line of 5 people do they slither to the counter.  Horrible business.

Review 0: Fast friendly and accurate service. The holiday pies are yummy. ...  The bathrooms are ean, and there was ample parking. ...  I'm easy pleased.


Review 1: Not too bad for a small town place.


Review 2: Stopped in here this morning for breakfast, joined by Robyn N.  UGH!  I often stop at a McDonald's to eat when I'm out of town, & usually think they're at least 3 Stars, but this one was a real dud today.  To begin with they weren't busy, possibly having as many employees as customers, yet it took us and everyone else a LONG TIME to get our orders from their simple menu!  Not only that, there were no paper towels in the men's bathroom, only those stupid blowers, mounted down near the floor (for 3-year-olds?).  The door opens IN, so how are you supposed to get out of there with your hands clean, wait 'til you can get into a stall to get some toilet paper? ...  ... My breakfast sandwich seemed like it had been sitting around for a long time, too.     :-O ...  ... Sausage McMuffin with Egg $2.69, Sr. Coffee $.79


Review 3: Super busy location and both times I have been here there is a huge line. It's almost like chaos in the lobby. I don't know if it is because it's a busy locaiton or because they are unorganized. I went inside then thought better and went through the drive thru where there was only one car ahead of me. The drive thru was fast but the prices were super high. $7.75 for a 10 piece McNugget meal. Wow! Won't be going there again. Next time I will either go to the Subway across the street or Taco Bell down the road!


Review 4: The ole usual stopoff place to Vegas. I might have to reconsider a new one. Today on the way home I stopped elsewhere. Saturday Morning 6/23/13 I stopped here on the way to Vegas. They remodeled the entrance and the parking lot. One person wrote that it has more parking. Hmmm, to me it seems like they have less now but either way it is not an improvement outside or inside. I walk in and the bathroom is closed (really?) I used the Men's room. A line of women followed me in as the manager begrudgingly stood guard. Who cares. Most places have Coed bathrooms nowadays anyway and I have 5 brothers. lol-- However, a lot of elderly ladies stop here and Mom's with babes. They might not be so happy. No one could even say how long the bathrooms would be closed for.  ...    After the bathroom fiasco, I ordered. The worker was very young and very unknowledgeable over basic things. Finally, the place was so dirty. I was appalled at how disgusting everything was. Ewhhhh! You would think they would keep it nicer since it is such a busy place for Roadtrippper Stopovers.


Review 5: This is a busy McDonald's.  This is one of the bathroom stopping points for travel between Las Vegas and Phoenix.  This is a subpar McDonald's.  Just ordering a couple simple things like fries and a hamburger for the kids but they messed up the order-incomprehensible.

Review 0: Clean.  Friendly.  Great customer service.  fast.


Review 1: I give this McDonald's 5 stars comparing it to other McDonalds restaurants in the Las Vegas/ Henderson area. service is fast whether you're in the drive-thru or ordering inside..


Review 2: If we go to Chipotle a little further down, we will hit this on the way back for $1 drinks.  Bargain dinner FTW.  Food is always correct when I order it and all the people that I've encountered there are pleasant. ...  ... I've been inside the restaurant itself once and it's nice & clean.  Most of the time I go through the drive-thru and always receive prompt service.  Easy in/out driveway which is a HUGE plus for me; enter from Eastern, exit onto St. Rose.  Wham, bam, thank you ma'am.


Review 3: This tasty Bacon Clubhouse Burger had a perfect zing of flavor that popped right after the first bite, and sent my taste buds on a first class trip to party city. As the box says, 'the different ingredients "mingle" on an artisan roll', and they form a flawless blend that puts a smile on your face. I would recommend it to anyone and everyone, as I find it is one of the most scrumptious things on McDonalds menu. They also provided fast, friendly, and accurate customer service. Definitely the best Mcdonalds out there!


Review 4: Though it might not be the healthiest option in the world, considering their is a subway across from the mcD, this McDonalds is available 24 hours. Since I'm a night owl I can get food any time I want which is great. Really cheap too, fills me up with only $5.


Review 5: very fast and friendly, clean and courteous, considering how busy they are on black friday


Review 6: very friendly staff, i complained about how they messed up my order at the other Mcdonald, the staff replaced my order here at no charge! wow


Review 7: We frequent this location as it is in our office buildings parking lot. This is a super busy [maybe one of the busiest locations I have ever been to!]; the drive-thru moves quickly and the service is always great and everyone is always very friendly.


Review 8: Went here with my son this past weekend...haven't been to this location in a while and sure enough nothing has changed.  Seriously, I don't know why I even dare take him to another location...oh I remember why...because this one doesn't have a play area :(.  However, taking him somewhere where he gets the slightest distraction from eating his entire meal makes for an unhappy mommy because he ends up not eating his food. ...  ... This location is CLEAN and NOT attached to a gas station (which I always thought was weird).  They even have fresh flowers on every table.  The drive thru is always busy; however if you go in it will save you time.  The staff are efficient...once you get their attention because they seem to be a bit chatty with one another.  The food was as good as it gets for a fast food joint and especially a McDonalds.  My son got a 4 piece chicken nugget Happy Meal and the fries were fresh from the fryer and was not just sitting under the heat lamp.  They were also not stingy with the BBQ sauce like most places and didn't charge us for an extra one as you only get 1 for a happy meal. ...  ... Will definitely be coming back here again when there's a good toy out...


Review 9: Ok let's not talk about the food. We all know it's bad for you and evil, whatever. What I like about this particular McDonald's is the face to face drive through!  I love not yelling into a speaker and hoping they heard me correctly. It's so refreshing to just talk to someone face to face. I haven't been here a lot, but I can say I've had no errors in my food - quite impressive.


Review 10: So reviewing McDonald's is like reviewing America. It's been around a while and everybody has had time to form their own opinion. The thing I will review today is their new oatmeal. I usually hit Starbucks every morning before the gym for coffee and their "perfect oatmeal" as they call it. I like it enough and it's a cheap, healthy, low calorie breakfast. I was curious when Micky D's started pitching their own. I have now tried it a few times at a few different locations and have to admit, it might be better! It's a tad more money and a tad higher in calories but it tastes and looks lie a better product.  ...  ... Next time you are hitting that drive thru for a sausage/bacon/Mcbiscuitmuffin sandwich, try the oatmeal instead and give your body and wallet a small break!


Review 11: So, very hot day in vegas... well, compared to Mountain View, CA that is... I had some scrap steel I wanted to sell, and had just carried a load to my local recycler... and  I was thirsty.... My wife and I decided to swing by McD to get our favorite Wild Berry Smoothie and went to the drive thru. ...  ... The drive thru at this McD is unusual in that there is actually a live person at a window (they have 3 windows, one to order, one to pay, and one to get food) taking orders. Before I said anything, he's like, "would you like to try our new mango pineapple smoothie?"... I said, "well, I was going to order our favorite, wild berry smoothie.." He says, "the Mango Pinapple is much better.... you can put Baccari's in there and it would make a great frozen drink too"  Sold! ...  ... It was good! The syrupy sweetness of mango with the sweet tang of pineapple was very refreshing on this hot Vegas day... it just might become my new favorite.


Review 12: Went here after a soccer game for lunch around 1PM and it was crazy in the parking lot making it hard to find a spot.  Once in we placed our order but going to a McDonalds drive through or not I always get pickles and onions when I ask for them not to put any on.  Maybe I speak softly or maybe I am speaking in a different language.  I didn't even go back to get a new one since the line was so long. But, I have to say this location is very clean.  They always have someone cleaning up inside and outside the location.  No kid area but after a great game of soccer my daughter just needed to worry about her lunch.  We would go back again and maybe I will just order something else that doesn't have onions or pickles say a salad which would be good for my hips.


Review 13: Does McDonald's really need a review? ...  ... It's hot outside, so it's a perfect place to grab a cheap drink. I also like their McCafe coffees. ...  ... Food obviously less than mediocre, but we all love the dollar menu. ...  ... Line was horrendous around 1:00pm.


Review 14: Free wifi saved my butt when mine at home froze up! And I was there late enough to get a free apple pie that someone ordered but never picked up!


Review 15: The get me my coffee AND it's a surprisingly clean restaurant.  ...  ... Can't be a $1.08 cup of joe.


Review 16: What can I say about good ol' McDonalds. ...  ... Morning & Late night orderings lines do get pretty long.  Especially since its near the freeway so it gets pretty hectic.  ...  ... Had there big breakfast & oatmeal several times and the oatmeal is pretty dry! I wish they put a little more milk or something in there. ... Also, i tried the dipped cone & was not good.  ...  ... But McDonalds fries are never a disappointment :)


Review 17: It's McDonalds that should say a lot. I really don't like the way their drive thru works... Why cant I just order at the board? It would be so much easier if you had the menu in front of you to double check what the guy at the window is saying... It's not like they were going to getting right anyway. I do give McD's credit for having great ice cream! I don't know why but I have always loved their cones... It's really the only edible thing there.


Review 18: We frequent McDonalds quite often with a little 5 year old.  I didn't notice this location had the f-t-f service so I am sitting waiting for someone to say "May I take Your Order?" - just a friendly honk from behind me to nudge me away.  The gal at the 1st window was very nice so that is for the one star rating I gave this location.  I get to the window and the gal doesn't even greet me and gives me the wrong item.  I ordered a milkshake WITHOUT whipcream.  The order was correct but she made it incorrectly.  For some reason I throw up by having this so I see her through the window off to the side taking off the whip cream.  She comes back to the window and I told her that I saw what she did and that I can't have it or I will end up across the street in ER.  She still doesn't say anything and goes to make another milkshake and gives me the milkshake without saying sorry or thank you for coming to McDonalds.  Aghhhh.  My big pet-peeve with ALL the McDonalds they NEVER give nor offer ketchup when you get fries and once again this happened.  If you are going to offer friendly face to face service please live up to that.  I hated this location and the grumpy girl - get a new job girl or a new attitude.  With so many people out of work McDonalds could have hired a friendly person.  Geeeeeez

Review 0: Normally, I try to stay away from fast-food in general and McDonald's specifically. However, whenever I have a craving for McDonald's, this particular location is my favorite. They do brisk business so all my meals were hot and fresh. Inside the restaurant is cleaner than most other stores and the staff have been mostly friendly and helpful. You should expect a wait in the drive-through, but that just means your order will most likely be just-made and hot (think fries).


Review 1: This is about as good as McDonald's gets in Las Vegas.  Sometimes they forget things in my order, but everybody is friendly, fast and the food is always cooked properly.  It's weird how the ingredients at one location can vary so much.  Everything is always fresh here.


Review 2: Hair was found in food replaced it but made me feel like the bad guy about it. Not cool guys


Review 3: Food took a while it was at night I was looking at apartments on that street all the way up the street but this is the only McDonalds in the vicinity and there's no other real restaurant in for a mile or two going up to Henderson

Review 0: As far as mcdonalds go, this one is one of the better ones. I come here a lot - 27 check ins so far! Ive never had bad service here that i can recall. The management must be doing something right! Kudos to you guys! Plus the kids LOVE the indoor play area here. Its big, accessible, and closed off so my kids arent as tempted to run off. And it has its own bathroom, WITH a changing table - hard to find in vegas. They also occasionally have special events, like ronald mcdonald visiting. 5 stars.


Review 1: Came here for breakfast since we missed our breakfast meal period at our conference. I ordered a Sausage Egg McMuffin meal. It tasted delicious and not dry. They got our order correct the first time. Not a lot of seating though but we were lucky to get one.


Review 2: We love to come here daily for a large Diet-Coke and a fruit parfait. The drive thru can be a bit slow at times, but they always cook their hash browns to the perfect crisp.


Review 3: Wow. I cant believe that I haven't written a review for this place. ...  ... It's almost always busy. Morning, afternoon,night, there's cars in the drive thru. ...  ... The staff is always kind. Most fast food places looks like everyone who works there hates their lives. ...  ...  Sometimes the guys on the late shift dance around for you.... Real positive energy! My order has never been wrong, or incomplete here, either. ...  ... If the food isn't "classy" or "healthy" enough for you, don't eat here. I like shopping organic, and what not, but anything in little doses will not hurt you.


Review 4: I pretty much only come here to treat my son.  So I took my son here because he loves to play in the kids playground area which is pretty neat for youngsters.  The food just isn't what I used to think when I was younger.  The fries are generally pretty good, unless you get served some cold fries which is disgusting.  I had the double quarter w/cheese + bacon.  It was pretty good, but the burgers are not served HOT like many other fast food places.  I would like to see the cheese melted to my bun from the heat.  Service was pretty much exactly what I would expect, nothing too great, but nothing to complain about either.


Review 5: I walked in for a coffee today. I was looking a little more scrubby than normal and figured that the normal patrons and staff of McDonalds might be a little more understanding than a coffee house. I ordered a single iced coffee, paid, and waited at a table opposite the registers. At the time I was the only one there, but shortly after about 10 people got in line. I waited. And waited. And waited. No coffee? I thought that maybe they'd just needed to get their drive customers out of the way before moving on to my ticket. But people after me started receiving their food. 15 minuted after ordering a SINGLE COFFEE I waited through line and handed my receipt to the cashier. She said they must have skipped me and went to give the ladies my ticket by hand. Another 5 minutes later I had my coffee and was on my way. Sorry, McDonalds, I am not interested in waiting 20 minutes for a coffee.


Review 6: in line at drive thru for 11 mins. so far...4 cars in frnt of me.  service a joke...12 min. til order recd.

Review 0: The food at this McDonalds is the best place to eat at.


Review 1: Not impressed with this Walmart McDonalds. As the cashier told the two customers that asked for a Frape Caramel, "This is the only location that doesn't have Frape Caramels (not sure about that )." The tables were also dirty (felt consciousness about taking a picture with the customer there). With an In & Out Burger in the parking lot, I would have to be craving a Big Mac or not want to deal with a walk in hot temperatures to eat anything more than $5 here.


Review 2: Since when do they put cheese in a Filet O' Fish sandwich?  It's been awhile since I ate at this franchise. Haven't set foot and bought a meal here in a while, but I was feeling lightheaded when shopping and I ended up here because it was the nearest place to get a bite to eat.   ...  ... Staff was pleasant. It was near closing, no line, 3 employees handled my order. So I got my order remarkably fast. Which made me wonder how long was my food under those warmers. Well I was just about to find out! ...    ... Opened up my sandwich and I kid you not, there was a slice of dried up cheddar cheese in the the filet fish sandwich...ewwww...(see pic) I didn't want to bother remaking it, so I just picked it off.  Then I took a bite. Yup under the heat lamps for too long alright.  The sandwich was way too dry.  The bun wasn't stale at least.  Only got in two little bites and I was done.   The fries were the saving grace though.  It was hot and crisp, so I had a few of those till I wasn't dizzy no more and chucked the rest of my meal.   ...  ... At the time of my visit near closing, the tables were clean, the soda fountain area was not maintained though. Ice cubes and melted ice all over the place.  The trash bins were full. One of them had trash bulging out of it..gross. ...   ... The prices on Mickey D's so not worth the $6 I paid. I can go across the street and get a cooked to order meal that isn't loaded with sodium and preservatives over at the Filipino restaurant for the same price! So I'd skip this place unless you are in desperate need to eat.


Review 3: This has got to be the WORST McDonalds ever. I will never go to this McDonalds again. Cashier repeated my simple order back to me 5 times, service was mediocre and I was just unimpressed.

Review 0: First McDonald's I remember going to with an automatic door. Nice.


Review 1: I love how they redecorated this McDonalds. Looks so modern. N I like how it's like more like a lounge now with the comfy chairs n flat screen tvs. Definitely a lot cooler than most fast food restaurants


Review 2: Theyre remodeling so this is for the new double laned drivethru. The service has always been accurate here but now its twice as fast! Im really pleased. Hope the remodel makes it a five star experience!


Review 3: This McDonald's recently got remodeled and it looks SWANKY now! Very modern decor inside and a 2 lane drive thru outside! They have a lounge area when you first walk in with leather couches and a huge flat screen tv on the wall. I guess to hang out and drink coffee? ...  ... The seating area has a variety of tables and chairs all modern/retro looking which I liked. The service inside is fast as well as in the drive thru. The food is.....well it's McDonald's you know what's it like :D


Review 4: Update: the remodel makes this fast food place a much hipper experience. The play area is the same but theres a different seating setup. They also have tvs now. 4 stars.


Review 5: Yay oh Yay oh Yay!!! ...  ... I usually don't go to fast food restaurants; okay,,, I rarely go eat at a fast food joint.  However, with the breaking news that the McRib is back!!!  I had to go.  I have no idea why they only sell this once a year for only like 5-6 weeks!  Why oh why!??? ...  ... My wife thought I was crazy, but I went and bought 8 of these puppies last night.... gave her one, I devoured two, and stuck the other 5 in the fridge for tomorrow's delight. ...  ... I guess I am one sick person... LOL....


Review 6: It's a McDonalds, so I'm sure everyone knows what to expect here. They try to get you through as fast as they can with not much in the way of smiles or true customer service. I wish my kids didn't love Happy Meals so much, then I'd probably never eat here. But since they do, I'll snack on a Grilled Chicken Sandwich or just grab a Caramel Frappe. I have to say, this location seems to be consistently fast. The lines can really wrap around the building here, but I've never had to wait long at all. I like that, so three stars it is!


Review 7: This location was remodeled, the most significant change is the drive thru (at least for me, since I only order through drive thru now). It now has two lanes, which from my experience, surprisingly has quick service. Besides that, nothing significantly different from other Mickey D's.


Review 8: If you have an option to go to a different Mc Ds, do it, I have given this location several "tries". A few months back Mc Ds as a whole changed the amount of syrup they put in the iced coffees...ok, so I now ALWAYS order extra syrup which they charge me $.50 for at this location (most other coffee places don't do this) ok, charge me $.50 BUT if you do then you may actually want to give me what I've PAID for. I've made a habit when I go here to check, today I made the mistake not to because I was in a hurry & guess what, no extra syrup. This has happened more times than not. I will go out of my way to get my iced coffee w/ extra syrup at another location where they only charge $.30 & they get my order right more often than not.


Review 9: It got remodeled so it looks nice. Too bad I can't say the same about the drive thru staff. I swear, they are always in such a rush that they screw up your order 70% of the time. It's annoying to repeat your order three times and they still screw it up. Can you guys slow the heck down enough to actually listen and pay attention please?


Review 10: They are extra slow Yeah yeah this location is a pretty little Mc Donalds that's just extra slow. The service is omg why did I come here slow. Don't get in the drive thru its like a death trap because once your in line your just trapped with no way out no matter what. (Your order will NEVER EVER be correct.) Can I have a cheese burger? Well, when you open ya bag you will have chicken nuggets.  I wish I could give them a big fat zero just no stars at all ....NOPE.

Review 0: Good location, s-l-o-w service.  Funny crew, on a trip through the drive thru, the cutie taking my order for a Happy Meal, asked if I would like a girl or a boy toy?, I excitedly answered "Oh!, I'll take a Boytoy!", he must of thought I was a dirty old lady, he'd be half right!


Review 1: It's a typical Mcdonald's with a play area that's great for kids to run around and burn off some energy.  It hasn't been renovated like many other Mcdonalds around town but I'm sure it will be done sooner rather than later.  Food was exactly what we ordered and was hot and tasty.


Review 2: McDonald's will be McDonald's so I've based my review on service alone. cashier had no personality. He didn't smile or even was interested on working. He looked and sounded miserable taking my order. The manager on the other hand gave me my food with a smile and even cracked a joke. it was a morning shift so that employee needs to cheer up and smile more and spread positive vibes especially when people are just starting their day.


Review 3: Horrible !!!!  The teenagers who work here are more interested in socializing than serving customers.  I have been coming to this location for over a year because it is close to my house , but must say I will drive a little further now just so my order will be correct !  I dont understand ????? Are suburb teenagers IQ's going so far down that they cant get even master a cheeseburger fries and drink order?   I get excellent correct orders at Maryland pkwy and trop location on my way to work!!!!  I challenge the owner if this location to order  a meal here and I would be beyond shocked if it is hot and correct!  One example: i ordered a cone a diet coke and 2 coffee.  They give me 2 coffee.  I say " my cone?"  He looks at the big bright screen with the order and  says " oh ya ".  Gives me my cone.   Then a few seconds pass.  " my diet coke ?"  Once again another long hard look at the screen followed by a puzzled look and another " uggggghh oh ya".  Need I say more.  Go somewhere else !!!!!


Review 4: I am only giving this location one star, because you can't give zero stars. This location can't get anything right. First, my order is wrong or incomplete 7 out of 10 times. Second, the food comes out cold or the fries will not be salted often. Third, a manager/shift supervisor was extremely rude to me simply because I went through the drive thru w/ two separate orders. Fourth, if you want ice cream it's a crap shoot. You never know if the machine will work. TERRIBLE! Worst McDonalds on the planet!!!!


Review 5: I stopped coming to this location because they NEVER give you napkins in the drive-thru..employees here are pretty grumpy.


Review 6: I usually do not care to write reviews for fast food chains, but this was the strangest experience we have had in a drive thru in a long time.  When we pulled up to the first menu, we did not see a window so we glanced at the menu and pulled forward to the next menu where the intercom usually is located.  We did not see one and another car was already behind us.  We went around the building thinking that we missed it at the first menu only to find that located at the second menu was a big unlit sign stating that it was "personal face-to-face service" and we were to order at the window...really???  We pulled up to the first window and no one was there and neither was there a sign stating to move forward to the next window.  We took the risk and pulled forward.  A few seconds later a lady wearing the supervisor uniform took our order while giving another employee a hug and having a conversation with another employee.  Then we saw the car behind us paying for and placing their order at the first window!  Then the lady who took our order came back with our food and was trying to give us some change when she realized it belonged to the car behind us.  The food was cold and old...very confusing and horrible experience at what should have been just a simple drive thru service.  I am not surprised by the low ratings this location has received.


Review 7: If I could give this McDonald's a negative star I would!  Absolute worst McDonald's I have ever been to.  They NEVER get your order right.  The kids taking your order are usually texting or on their cell phones while you are trying to order.  The fry containers are always half empty.  They ALWAYS have a hand written sign hanging up on the drive thru that explains what they are out of.  One time it was hamburger patties!  We live around the corner but choose to drive an extra 5 minutes and go to any McDonald's that is not owned by the Lipscomb & Smith franchisee. Terrible....F!


Review 8: If they had no stars available i would give them no stars- the management has failed to train their staff properly or the kids they hire are just dumb and lazy- either way i have contemplated working there as a manager just to overhaul the staff. I have yet to have gone through the drive thru and get what i ordered. The poor reviews should be a wake up call to this mcdonalds manager and owner- get a clue! I will no longer be visiting this mcdonalds and i hope this review along with all the other 1 stars help dissuade any future customers.


Review 9: McDonald's usually is good for an inexpensive, decent quick bite when you've been drinking. However, I hate clarifying 2 times that I'm ordering an unsweetened iced tea and receive a disgustingly saccharine sweet tea. I mean, this location is one that you order face-to-face through drive-thru!   ...  ... Here's the conversation:  "I'd like an unsweetened iced tea," I pronounced.  ...  ... "sweetened or unsweetened?" asked the careful listener.  ...  ... "unsweetened," I replied.  ...  ... You know the rest of the story... ...  ... Oh, and the southern style chicken hockey puck was both dry and burnt.  ...  ... This McDonald's receives 1 star because they were able to make a usual shitty dining experience even shittier.


Review 10: This McDonalds is absolutely awful.  It always seems like it is never open, its not open 24 hours like most locations, and the service is very horrible and slow.  The line is always long and as said, the place is so slow.  Their quality for a bacon egg and cheese biscuit is very low.  The best location is Pecos and Bonanza.  This one Valle Verde and Paseo Verde is the worst.


Review 11: Walked into this place for the first time to get an ice cream cone while my wife shopped at nearby pet store. The older lady wearing glasses behind the counter asked me if I wanted it To-Go, "To-Go" ? it's an ice cream cone. Anyway I said To-Go, this lady then gave me the biggest Yarn as she handed me my change, then I watched her drop some kind of plastic cup on to the floor, but didn't pick it up right away. She looked like she didn't want to be there at all. i watched her prepare my ice cream cone, then she decided to pickup that cup she dropped on the floor earlier, what gets me is the way she picked it up, looked like as if she was picking up a 400 lbs weight at the gym. Then, as she was handing me my ice cream she says to me "Welcome", "Welcome" for What?  I haven't said my Thank You yet !,  as if she was doing me a big favor.  I grewup in Japan where a customer service is probably the best in the world so maybe I'm little too critical. But I do know one thing, if this was a McDonalds in Japan, she be so Fired !


Review 12: We should have read reveiws first! I'm amazed that one store in a chain can be so consistently terrible. We have now had our order screwed up three times in a row- that's three for three. We have an endlessly growing tab of free stuff from every time we have called to complain abour our order being wrong.  The last time we got home with the incorrect order it was actually the store manager who completely screwed our stuff up! If you are going to bother hitting this restaurant against all recommmendation that you do not, , make SURE before you leave that the incompetent workers haven't botched your food!  I GUARENTEE that they have.


Review 13: Why do I keep falling into this hellhole?! ... 4 times, yes, 4, the most I chances I have given a place...either they: ... a) Are out of whatever you want. ... b) Have bad attitudes. ... c) Give you cold food. ... d) Give you melted down frozen strawberry lemonade that looks like puke, I should have taken a picture so that you would know I am not making it up. ... I am going to yell now, ready? STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE!!!


Review 14: Worst McDonalds in the history of McDonalds. All of their employees are rude, serve cold food, and have bad attitudes.. Your better off with Taco Bell  a mile away.  ...  ... Don't waste your time, or money.

Review 0: Yes!  It finally happened with drive thru.  Ok, I just got a mocha frap drink but the kid was so excited since the driver in front of me looked like Rachel Ray I got a smile and I got a really good drink.  I even got a straw too!  I have to give them a thumbs up!  I have to say I love the drink and please don't tell my friends at Starbucks but I like it better than the Mocha Frap there.....shhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!  plz don't tell!  :)


Review 1: Ate breakfast on a Saturday morning. The drive-thru was crazy busy!  ...  ... We went inside, and got our food quickly and efficiently. Quality was good, and the lobby was clean. As good as it gets for McDonald's grub!


Review 2: becoming a fan of the mcfrappes and smoothies. mcnuggets are always a good choice and easy to eat. drive thru os always busy go inside to avoid the wait. one time they made me park around the corner to give me my shamrock shake.


Review 3: I asked them NO meat on my breakfast brisket and it was repeted to the person makin it.and when I got it there was becon on it.. but eggs were good n fresh


Review 4: I used to live on this side of town and would come here once in awhile. Back then, the service was alright. I had to wait once in awhile at the front because the drive through was backed up. And they would get my order right. Today, when I stopped for a quick bite to eat before class, I went through the drive through and was surprised that the line wasn't too crazy. I ordered a McDouble, no pickles, medium french fries and a large sweet tea. Paid & got my food - awesome quickness. BUT when I got to school and started to eat - my cheese burger had pickles. Not only did it have pickles, it had the receipt that said "(1) McDouble; NO pickles." And my sweet tea was watered down and not so sweet, more like bland. Also, my french fries was thrown in the bag & practically poured out of the little holder. ... Really McDonald's? We're going to lower our food services because we have an updated drive through terminal? Just because I go through drive through, does not mean you RUSH me through. I like my food to be made to order. Thanks.


Review 5: This Mcdonalds has drastically improved since they put in the new drive-thru system.  I used to have to pull around front everyday and wait extra time for food or coffee. ... The only real issue I have is that their specialty coffee is never consistent.  It tastes different everytime!


Review 6: I just came back from here. The drive thru was crazy, of course because of the time (1130).  ...  ... There was a young employee setting up an umbrella and a sign. He was the ONLY one who was nice, which you would think, in this heat, he would be a little snappy. ...  ... The other two employees I greeted, said "hello" to, asked them how they were. No response. ...  ... Unreal. But my order was right.


Review 7: On occasion they give good service but for the most part everyones rude and fries are stale. I hate this location and wouldn't come back if it wasn't for my son who of course like many children don't know any better and love McDonald's.


Review 8: On two separate occasions my husband and I brought our kids here for some happy meals and play time and there was some kind of spit or snot in my drink the first time and some kind of spit or snot in two of my three kids drinks the second time. ...  ... I ALWAYS look before any of us drink from any fast food and thank goodness I do!! ...  ... I will never take my kids there again and I don't advise anyone go to that location. ...  ... We are sending a letter to corporate.


Review 9: shit !  It took 25 minutes to get my food at 12:30 in the afternoon on Friday the 11th. I'm not going back


Review 10: The credit card system is down  and they don't tell you until you get up to order. So than you are stuck in line to pull through.


Review 11: Wanted to use drive-thru but saw there was 10 cars in line so I opted to go inside where the line was just as long.  I was inside for over 20 minutes waiting for my order.  They didn't plan for the rush and there were no fries ready.  Also, when the girl poured the milkshake into the cup she got milkshake all over the cup.   If I didn't ask her to clean it she would have given it to me like that.  There was only one person on cash registers and the staff helping him were not giving the cups for the soda.  Also, they ran out of Caeser dressing packets for the salads too.  The genlemen at the cash register was very nice but the supervisor was rude.  I only like coming her because my daughter likes McDonalds.  I do like the location in Henderson that has the space ship play structure, better location and better customer service.


Review 12: Why do I go here - because it is the closest to my home.  Why bother here anymore.  Running late from work picked up the family and we came thorugh drive-through around 6:30PM with NO ONE else in line in Drive through.  The F-T-F service we were stuck with some one new learning the cash register (I am patient - everyone needs to learn)  I can hear throught the window the employees goofing off singing and laughing really loud and no one helping this cashier out.  Three of us ordered.  Out of three only my daughter's happy meal order was correct.  I asked for no mayo they gave it to me, my husband asked for no pickles and they gave it to him and I wanted a large chocolate milkshake and they gave me a medium.  I even said I ordered a large and the girls response was "well, it says medium".  She gives me the drinks first WITHOUT straws and gives me the bag of food WITHOUT ketchup.  I ask is the straws in the bag her response "I don't know I don't bag them I just hand them to you" - I look at her and say "Well, can I get straws?"  And then the same question about the ketchup "Well, can I get ketchup?"  When we got home and the order was incorrect I was pissed.  I really think they didn't want to make a fresh order and knew that we would be forced to eat it since it was ordered through drive through.  What is up with promoting F-T-F service - Everything about this locations sucks!  I think it is time for us to get healthy and go to Tropical Smoothie which has healthy items and for kids too.


Review 13: You guys are all going - Why does she continue to go there?  Well it is all about the toy in a kid's meal - come on people.  No straws, No Napkins and No ketchup through drive thru?  Huh?  Just don't get it.  I love their Mocha Frap drink and so do my hips but I wish the corporate headquarters would send their own spies to see how much the drive-thru service sucks.  I do continue to go here because I have a 5 year old!  That is why!  :)

Review 0: I am assuming this is the McDonalds that is located in the Plaza Hotel and Casino. If so, I would like to paste a snippet of my review of the Plaza here and say again, the service at this McDonald's is SUPERB:  ...  ... One other thing that really has nothing to do with the Plaza but wanted to mention. One day I was in line at McDonald's to get an iced tea. There was a man in front of me and then a man in a wheelchair being waited on. He looked to be pretty down and out (something you see whether downtown or on the strip) and was ordering some breakfast. I  heard the cashier say $4 something and I saw him put a dollar on the counter...I thought, uh-oh, she'll have to tell him not enough and wonder how he'll react,....well, he had put up a bunch of change and then I though the cashier would get ticked about having to count it all. I was so very wrong...she was so kind and so patient...counted it out and then told him he needed a few cents more so he gave her a dime and then she said, now I owe you a penny...with a big smile on her face. I am sad to say that her behavior just shocked me....I am so used to everyone being rushed and treated rudely...it has become so commonplace...as though we have to pay to be treated like decent human beings...and here this man paid for his coffee and food with change and was treated with extreme patience and kindness. It just really made me so happy and was one of the highlights of my stay in Vegas. I went to that McDonald's several times during my stay and the service was excellent every single time.


Review 1: I came here last June when I visited the historical Fremont St. for the first time. Can't really remember the service but it definitely wasn't bad for the amount of customers there. ...  ... I guess you can't really complaint though, it is Vegas after all and it's right at the entrance of a god damn casino. ...  ... But I think me and my Dad ordered some type of burgers and then came back when we got a coupon for a free new smoothie thing they had that came with our large soda. ...  ... The smoothie was excellent and I would definitely order another one some time. ...  ... But the only reason for this Mickey D's getting 1 star off, is simply because of the crowd/rowdiness.


Review 2: This place is funny! ...  ... They literally have a sign on the wall that says you can only sit and eat for a max of 20 mins!  So I hope you are hungry!!!


Review 3: Food Poisoning being served at the McDonalds here.  When I called to notify them, the manager at McD's tried to tell me that they would be more than  happy to offer me anything else I wanted to eat.  ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME?!? You really think I want to eat your food again??


Review 4: It's McDonalds. I'm going to assume we all have a handle on the food quality. But you go there for fast food. I mean, they practically invented the space. So if you want McDonalds and you want to eat at the Plaza, head to the one at the D hotel, order out and bring it back. You'll save yourself about 20 minutes of aimlessly loitering in the Plaza lobby. It's happened to me twice now. Never again.


Review 5: Why would anyone go to this place, when there are a literally a million other places to go? Why would anyone bother to write a review? Whats there to review? The card board tasting imitation beef? or the reconstituted chicken packed in to what they call a nugget or is it that you love your food to have a sir name; mac muffin, mac nuggets, mac ribs, mac chicken how about mac caca or mac poo poo.  Enjoy.


Review 6: Yuck.  Service and food both deplorable.  ...  ... How do you make McDonalds worse than it already is?  Shove it inside a low budget casino and employ nothing but hood rats.   ...  ... the one star is for it being cheap and quick when hammered inside the Plaza.  At that point diarrhea really isn't a beg deal.

Review 0: Good service but drive thru is slow!  When I pick up breakfast for the office- this is usu the place- but just to warn every1, I think going in is faster- but if you have a big order, you may get the stink eye from the other customers- just pretend to read the newspaper- or cont yelping to avoid eye contact!


Review 1: This place really is hit or miss on the service. ...  ... The food: cheap, that's why you go here. Period. ...  ... The service: Like I said, on & off. Sometimes they mess up. They're busy.. Cause of that heaven sent dollar menu. Love hate relationship guys. ...  ... Updates: They've got smoothies, & I love me some Mango Pineapple. Yum! :D ...  ... I would rate only 3 stars, but it keeps the 4th cause it's down the street.  ... I know, stupid reason. Well, shut it & write your own review... please. LOL.


Review 2: About as average as your local McDonald's can be.  This one is right up middle alley, not great but not spectacular either.  I just find it surprising the skinny-richie-constant work-outie people up here in Summerlin keep this place busy!  I mean literally not even a block away is Lifetime Fitness!  That place is hardcore. ...  ... Food = OK.  Service = OK.  Fast and efficient as a colonoscopy.  Really nothing of greatness at this McDonald's.  Really run of the mill.  We often visit this location if we are staying in the nearby Red Rock Casino.  Although I would suppose this location stays steadily busy is in part because of the tourists that stay at the Red Rock as well and want cheap eats while on vacation.  Gotta make up for all those lost wages! ...  ... Newest thing at McDonald's is their health-conscious Egg White 'Delight' McMuffin.  Definitely a healthier take on their breakfast menu.  And yes, I fell for that damn $1 coupon conveniently stuck to my McDonald's bag and tried one.  Myself being a bit of a health nut can't complain.  This egg white creation is pretty tasty.  Grilled egg whites, Canadian bacon (eh?), and white cheddar all on a toasted English muffin?  All for only 250 calories?  Yeah for a dollar I really liked it.  But at the regular price of almost $3?  I would have probably passed.  With coupon for $1 and a $1 coffee it made for a nice meal on the small scale of economy.  I almost, ALMOST, added a $1 hash brown.  Luckily I passed and decided to save my money & calories for later. ...  ... Other than that, I think majority of people around the world know what McDonald's offers on their menu.  If you don't, dang, you must be living under a rock?  Or possibly a place where there is no McDonald's within your vicinity (like under a rock).


Review 3: After yet another night of insane Vegas partying - and enjoying alcohol a-flowin' - we got the munchies. Where did we decide to go? When it's late and you want something cheap and easy (insert favorite jokes here), very little tops fast food. ...  ... We drove to a random McDonald's with a KFC next door - FYI, there are a LOT of them between the Strip and Red Rock (our hotel). At the drive-thru, we placed an order for large fries and 20 Chicken McNuggets. ...  ... When we went to get our food, we were told they were out of large fries - how does that happen??? - and were given hash browns as a substitute. Since it was between three and four in the morning, we didn't press the issue. ...  ... Anyway, the McNuggets were piping hot, fed us, and I have no idea what happened to those hash browns. What happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas, right?


Review 4: I must say that I had a smoothie here when they came out months ago and they are horrible and way too sweet. Sonic has better ones and McD's obviously doesn't use real fruit. Even at midnight, this is not the best sweet tooth option. Wait, there is a positive. Using my 2-1 coupon, I tried the new Strawberry Frozen Lemonade and yes like the commercials indicate it is tart and sweet. These would be a better option to cool you down at $1.59 for a small. The strawberry syrup at the bottom might be the same they use on sundaes, but who knows for sure. McDonald's comes out with new stuff every month, but in the beverage department, frozen lemonade is king.


Review 5: I stop here now and then as it's the closest to where I live.  Customer service used to be awful, but ti seems like they've gotten a bit better.   ...  ... Today I got a side salad and a shamrock shake.  Everything was A-OK!


Review 6: I've been through in on a number of occasions and have never had a problem. ...  ... Food is typical Mcdonalds and it's always hot so nothing to complain about here. The drive through is usually fast.  ...  ... As for whether or not the staff is friendly, I usually go here early in the morning, so I really don't care. I'm not friendly myself in the morning LOL     So as long as my order arrives promptly and they don't talk much and my coffee is hot  I'm good with it.


Review 7: My least favorite fast food place but my daughter's favorite so we make the appearance every now and then.  McDonalds has the best kids meals and playplaces so for my seven year old this is a great place.  Love the apple slices and much smaller fry bags for the kids.The sundays are good and the recently added smoothies are great.  Very disappointed in the new popcorn style chicken. It is worse than KFC's popcorn chicken was before they made larger pieces.  In fact, most of my box was just fried coating with little or no chicken.    As fast food places go, I find McDonalds the most consistent in quality and taste.  I love their breakfasts and the chicken nuggets are still the best.  Avoid the angus burgers.  They are not as good as advertized.


Review 8: This is the 2nd closest McDs to my house. The closest one is so inconsistent that I come to this one more often. The drive thru can be long  and they often run out of cinnamon melts but the food is at least the way I ordered it and hot when I get it. The inside is clean and a mad house during breakfast time. All in all a decent location.


Review 9: Yes...it has come to this.  I only feel compelled to write this review because I work nearby, and I visit this McDonalds at least once a week.  I admit, I am a Dollar Menu addict. Where else can you get reasonably full for less than $5 for lunch. Nevermind the guilt and dangerous chemicals. ...  ... Anyway, the set up of the drive through makes for a real pain during peak lunchtime hours. This McDonalds is situated in a busy shopping center, right next to a Starbucks, Del Taco, Albertsons, Bank of America, and other shops. Things get rather congested and hard to maneuver.  However, as McDonalds goes, it is fine. The service is usually friendly and prompt (although the new guy they have in the drive thru is a *tad* too chatty!), and they haven't messed up my order.  Freshness and hotness varies, however.


Review 10: Maybe it's just me, but it seems like the staff at this location isn't all that friendly.


Review 11: Micky D's should all be the same, but this one in the 10 plus year I've been going there has about the most stand offish unfriendly people ever. It starts from the top so I guess the owners just don't care if there employees are unfriendly.


Review 12: Be careful!  I ordered an iced drink @ the drive thru.  The guy @ the second window never said hi or thanks.  I thought my drink was just wet on the outside.   Within minutes my  plastic cup was sticky.  By the time I got home my hands were sticky as well as my steering wheel, shifter, window controls.  It was a lot of work getting myself & the car cleaned.   ... I called the local office.  All she said was that she was sorry & she would tell them to wipe off the glasses.  She did not offer to have a manager call me &/or send me a gift card. ... I emailed corporate.  All I have received is a form email  back.  It's been 5 days.  I think I will stick w/iced-tea lemonades @ Coffee Beans & Tea Leaves.  Bye MacDonald's!


Review 13: Came to this McDonald's Friday, 7/5/13, forgot to check in though, lol!!  ...  ... Anyways, McDonalds is suppose to be a family joint right?!, especially when they have the playland, well how is it that this place, knowing people come with kids off all ages, NOT have a changing table in the restroom???? Unbelievable!!  ...  ... I will say though at least this place is clean and nice but what I dont like is that they dont have a ketchup dispenser they just have ketchup packets, I personally don't like that all.


Review 14: Seriously, this probably was the least friendly McDonald's ever.  Other than asking for our order, which was 3 coffees, they didn't say anything to us when we went to the drive-thru window or when we picked up the coffees.  Not one word.  We said thank you at each window. ...  ... Will not go back to this McDonald's for anything.


Review 15: They didn't even deserve the 1 star I gave them. We went to this McDonalds and ordered some food. The food was good but I had some power tripping Mgr. Tell me and my son that we couldn't fill my Starbucks cup up with water....when I asked why she said because of cross contamination.....( now keep in mind this is a self service soda  machine) so that argument doesn't really fly since everybody using the machine is cross contaminating it.  This women poked my hand out of the way.....I'm like really women.....I left....and she says in a sarcastic tone....God bless you....I'm like he already has.... Get a life women!


Review 16: This is the worst McDonald's I have ever been to by far. I cannot think of enough bad things to say about their service. ... The Food is standard McDonald's fair, but, they did not give us our drinks with creamer, our order was wrong, the food oatmeal came without enough spoons for the orders count, we had to go back 3 times for all sorts of condiments, and they dish em out reservedly like their lives depend on it. ... They do not seem to understand foreign accents and this is Las Vegas, seriously, if you are going to run a shop in a tourist town, you might as well be prepared for it.

Review 0: I truly never thought that I would write a review about a McDonalds but I guess I am. I hate to say this but you ALWAYS need to check your bags for your food, this goes with every fast food restaurant. This particular location has done an amazing job at really stepping up their game to ensure that they are getting orders right.


Review 1: good service, quick, polite, what more can you ask from McDonald's right?


Review 2: How does one go about writing a review for McDonalds?  They are everywhere!  So I've prepared a brief thank you letter for Ronald and the gang.   ...  ... Dear McDonald's Restaurants,   ...  ... Thank you for having a value menu.  I appreciate that I can order not one but two hamburgers, french fries, and cherry pies for about $4.  Thank you for saving me some money on the days where I only have a few bucks in my wallet.  Thank you inventing the covenanted sausage McMuffin with egg.  You truly are a delicious treat in the morning when I need to put something in my belly to start my day.  Thank you for making your hash browns, a hand held oval replica of you famous french fries.  Thank you for inventing a rib sandwich that only resembles a cartoon version of ribs.  Your tangy bar b que sauce, and the sparse toppings of onions wrapped up in your sesame seed bun is always a treat as you make your appearance for a few weeks each year.  Thank you for being available 24 hours to present your inexpensive delights to me at all hours of the night.  You never disappoint with my low expectations when I dine at you restaurants in Las Vegas and around the world.    ...  ... Sincerely,  ...  ... Ernesto R.   ...  ... Cheers!


Review 3: This is just a standard Vegas 24hr McDonald's which is attached to a Chevron that is the closest one to where I live. Always relatively clean and trash is taken out when I'm here. Breakfast, lunch and graveyard menu are up to standard which I'd expect from a $4-8 menu (ordering fries, spicy McChicken and McDoubles from the dollar menu and McNuggets). I finally had those Mighty Wings and they were pretty large and tasty!


Review 4: the service is either hit or miss


Review 5: Checking out the drive thur after reading all the 1 star reviews......let's see how they do.......everything is in the bag, fresh hot fries even!! Will check the rest of the food once we get home.........and FAIL!!!!! The Chicken Bacon Ranch Hot & spicy was missing both the bacon & the ranch!!!! Ordered 4 cheeseburgers, all 4 were old and cold as well as the 6 piece chicken nuggets...old and cold.  Way to Mc Ds, keeping up with the 1 star reviews.


Review 6: Every time I go their ice cream machine is down. It's a hang out for all the kids in the neighborhood. This establishment including terribles chevron connected to it, does not seem to care what goes on in or around their business. Low class for the area they are in.


Review 7: I never thought I would write a review of a McDonalds, much less have to write a negative review for a McDonald's. I don't even know how it's possible that a McDonald's could be so bad but unfortunately this one is.    ...  ... Like many people, I have eaten at McDonalds all over America and even in several other countries.  I have to say this is probably one of the worst McDonald's I've ever been to other than the one in Manila in the Philippines -and that's only because I'm not sure that what was in those burgers was even beef. ...  ... Where do I begin? The service is terrible. I have never, not ONE time, gotten what I ordered. I get sweet tea when I ask for unsweetened. I get cheese when I ask for none. I get onions when I ask for none. I get 2 chicken sandwiches when I ask for 4 apple pies.  I have given up on going through the drive thru because I always end up having to pull around, park, go in and wait in the long line of teenagers getting shakes  just to get them to correct my order. And even then, they don't get it right and I actually have to tell them, "No see, this is a Chicken Sandwich, I ordered a McDouble." ...  ... The food is almost always cold. The burgers are dry and taste like they have been sitting on a shelf for more than an hour. And the fry's..ugh! When there are 6 cars in the drive thru and 20 people in line, I just don't understand how the fry's can be cold and stale. It absolutely defies logic.  ...  ... Yes, there are times that the food comes out hot. It's one of the reasons I keep going back. There's nothing like hot Fry's from McDonalds.. and also, just because it's McDonald's. Like it or not, it's a staple for working parents too tired to cook dinner after work some nights. It is unfortunate that they have no competition in the immediate area to keep them on their toes, otherwise they might actually try to improve their service and their product. I am sure they are turning a profit. No doubt. It seems to always be busy. However, I truly believe that if ANY other burger joint opened up right next door, this place would close down in a month. Every time I say I'm never going back, I still do. Unfortunately, tonight will be one of those nights as the kids specifically requested it. The shear dread of what I'm about to go through is what prompted this review.   ...  ... I really hope they improve. It hurts to have to knock a McDonald's.


Review 8: I'm so upset with the drive through!! As you go to pull out the curb on the left is WAY too long and I ended up turning left and hit it... It ruined my tire and rim!! My friend told me they had done the exact same thing but they are I'm an SUV so there was no damage :( I'm so bummed right now!!


Review 9: Messed up our meal three times. Simple orders too. No sweet tea available. Non sense!


Review 10: Only ordered 4 items: apple pie, bbq Ranch Burger, small fries, and large Mocha frape. Still messed up my order. Made me wait because they ran out of Mocha mix. Gave me medium frap, no apple pie. Went inside told them I ordered large and the missing apple pie. They said there were no apple pies left. Made me wait more than 10 min. And incorrect order. Just left and disregarded the pie out of my frustration. So bad


Review 11: These guys never get any order right! How hard is it


Review 12: This is probably the worst night shift McDonald's ever!!! ...  ... Their drive through service is horrendous! When you approach the drive through you wait I would say at least 5 mins before someone acknowledges you from the speaker menu. ...  ... Tonight when I went to the first window to pay no one was there! The car in front of me already left leaving me to wonder if I needed to pull up to the 2nd window instead.  I pull up to the 2nd window only to have a staff member lecture me about not paying. Which by the way I already had my money out ready to pay but because it was an inconvenience for her to walk back to the first window she felt the need to argue first.  ...  ... To top things off they had the wrong order so I had to wait again for my order.  Believe it or not it took me about 20 mins for a 10 piece nugget meal!  ...  ... I thought its called fast food!


Review 13: This McDonalds. We hate going to this one because no matter what time of the day we go, they always mess up our orders. We have a big family, and every time, there are a few things always missing.


Review 14: Worse McDonald's ever!!!  I don't mind driving down to the Blue Diamond location from now on after several times the drive thru always forgets an item I ordered!  ALWAYS CHECK YOUR BAG BEFORE DRIVING AWAY FROM THE WINDOW!!   ... To top it off I had to drive back to get the burger they forgot and what compensation I get for my inconvenient???  2 effin Apple Pies....  are you kidding me???  - 5 Stars if I could rate it like that


Review 15: WORST MCDONALDS EVER! ...  ... Every single time we have been to this McDonalds on Southern Highlands Parkway we ask for our burgers and fries to be made up fresh.  They never are, in fact, they are cold and the buns are cold as well.  Step it up McDonalds!  Your reviews are bad and this is the Manager's fault!

Review 0: A McDonalds review? Yep. Because when all else fails it's really hard for someone to mess up a Big Mac. This location has a drive through that's not that bad to get through and usually moves fast at peak times. If you look through the drive through window or walk inside you'll notice it's kept clean.  ...  ... This McDonalds has kept me from being hungry when Lotus of Siam and Komol messed up my lunch more than once. And to be honest this review is just my way of saying thank you for being there as I know with a quick run through the drive through I won't be going back to work hungry.


Review 1: This one is located alongside Terrible's Gas Station, and the Albertson's Shopping Center/strip mall. We go to this one the most (though we really don't eat fast food on  a large scale anyway, ever since, our lifestyle changes), the Drive-Thru window mostly, and on occasion, inside too (clean, locals). This one is about the same distance from our home, as the one at Paradise/Sahara (way more tourists and way more cars at the Drive-Thru too), but this one is less crowded. Inside is a little smaller, than most locations, since it's sharing space with the Terrible's Gas Station and Convenience Mart. ...  ... Since we only get three items on the menu, our order's pretty easy (cone sundae, or sandwich), so it's usually right. There are usually a few cars in the Drive-Thru window too, BTW. But it's never too long of a wait.  ...  ... The gas station/mini-mart and the whole shopping center is relatively busy during the day.


Review 2: Between two shows last night, I had about 45 minutes to kill so I drove the short distance here to get a McFlurry.  For me, McDonald's has become a place to get a  side salad or a quick dessert.  Dessert it was. ...  ... The drive through was packed, so I parked at the convenience store parking and went inside.  The staff was very friendly.  The only issue I had was with adding to my Arch card account.  They couldn't remember how to do it.  After awhile, a light bulb went off and I had some money loaded on the card. ...  ... I got my Oreo McFlurry and I sat in the restaurant to enjoy it.  It was good--typical McDonald's--it's the same at each location.  The restaurant was relatively clean.  There was a table that needed clearing but other than that, it was neat.  There's also free wifi which made checking my email a breeze.  It was very snappy. ...  ... There are some pictures on the walls that look like they are made of jigsaw puzzle pieces. One was of Ray Croc.  I couldn't tell if they were real puzzle pieces or if the art had been designed to just look that way. ...  ... I'll be back when I'm in the area of Commercial Center and need a soft ice cream fix.


Review 3: The night employees from this particular mcdonalds are VERY RUDE!! I feel they don't care about the customers! And not only they make you wait a ridiculous amount of time but also are very careless! I don't recommend this mcdonalds! !!!

Review 0: If you're looking for a quick breakfast, you really can't go wrong with a breakfast sandwich and an iced coffee from McDonald's   This location is always quick...I've never had any issues with my orders or the employees here.  I've only had breakfast here so I can't comment on the rest of their menu. ...  ... My mom told me their oatmeal is really good...planning on trying that next time.  My husband also loves their cinnamon roll bites.


Review 1: I hate Mcdonald's I go tto be really really Hungry to eat there but my kids like it. This location service is what u expect from Mikey D's, nothing more nothing less.


Review 2: It's McDonald's. You really can't ever expect a good meal from any McDonald's. That said, however, I have no complaints about this location. My order has always been correct and speedy. And the food here is no worse than the food at any other McD's location. So can I really give it fewer than 3 stars? I guess not. ...  ... Psst...want to know what my favorite thing is from McD's? It's the hot mustard sauce. I could dip practically anything in that sauce. It is so yum!


Review 3: This review is only for the drive through. I enjoy the face to face ordering instead of the intercom. It gives a better chance for them to get your order correct. The staff here is very nice. There are a few people I can think of who are not morning people and should not be working the drive through, but I can't really choose who's working the window. The wait time depends on when you actually order. It's a little longer in the morning when everyone is off to work and when people are getting off work. As for my actual orders, I haven't had an order incorrect, although they have forgotten a straw here and there or have forgotten sauce or ketchup. I just make sure everything is there before I drive off.  ... Food wise, it's McDonald's. Nothing special.


Review 4: I am truly unimpressed with this location. I LOVE a cup of coffee in the morning and McDonalds has great coffee. This location seems to be run by a bunch of children with no other purpose other than goofing off. I sound like my father. How hard is it to be polite and serve a cup of coffee? With a thousand locations within a 5 mile radius, I think a will drive and extra block or two for that great cup of coffee.


Review 5: I was just there a few days ago.  I ordered my daughter a kids meal thru the drive thru.  The women at the first window was very nice and professional.  When we drove to the next window to pick up our food the women just handed us the juice then handed up our kids meal.  The whole time talking to fellow coworkers.  We saw only the back of her the whole time.  No hello no thank you or anything.  It was the weirdest thing.  My husband and I were shocked that happen.  Sorry Mcdonalds we were bothering you.  The funny thing I think she was the manager because she was wearing a different color than everyone else.


Review 6: OK McDonald's...Please check your beverage dispensing machine. On several occasions, I've had poorly mixed coke from your unit. The coke taste watered down. Are you trying to save on cost or did you run out of product?  Never compromise on my Coca Cola drinks, I would hate to cross over to another brand. Restaurants should be mindful of their dispensing units to ensure their lines have full bag in the box running through the lines and keep the ice maker full of ice. Thank you!

Review 0: I don't think this McD has ever been remodeled. Other than a badass painting of the McKingdom, there was another thing hanging on the wall which was pretty much a quilt with like cactus (cacti) sewn in to it and there was another case that had a bunch of old pins and buttons and I don't think there was a pin that was made later than 1982 or something. One was for "McDonalds Pizza" ...  ... This thing (the painting) was pretty badass though, that's why I took the pic. It's like 10' x 6'. I think it was dated 1979. Which makes sense considering that Mayor McCheese is there and the McKingdom is there too ...  ... I swear that place has been forgotten in time. Not only did it have the vintage artwork but the soda fountain was probably from the 80's as well because the ice machine and sodas were completely separate machines and there was a pay phone outside but it wasn't right outside the store, it was across the parking lot kind of in the bushes and had some weird phone company that I never heard of on it. Plus it had an electronic sliding door on the main entrance and the "Play Place" was outdoors and even had a sing that said "Please Do Not Feed The Birds". Such a weird place. It's cool because it reminds of the way McDonald's was when I was a kid but it's scary because it's not intentionally retro, it just never changed... ...  ... It's quite the experience. It's like the "Classic" McDonald's on Flamingo .....but a different kind of classic.


Review 1: Employees here really take pride in their restaurant.  They made sure the dining area was clean and their napkins and ketchup station was stocked up and clean.  Well organized restaurant.  Great job!


Review 2: This is my first time at this location and it was only through the drive thru. But tho the line was long I got through the line with in 15 min. The staff from taking my order to giving me my order was very nice. My order was CORRECT!!! That is a gold star in my book :)


Review 3: When you need a fast bite (breakfast, lunch, or dinner) so you can hit the road, this McDonald's is right off the 15 fwy on Charleston in the downtown area. It is clean, no bad people, and a fast drive thru. I gamble but not when it comes to fast and friendly McDonald's service. That is I like this one here.


Review 4: I used to go to this one a lot (when fast food was a regular staple in my diet, in my 20's, when my metabolism was faster, and when exercise was not such a priority)- this is one of the older ones in town.  ...  ... Recently, we went through the Drive-Thru window for some fruit smoothies. There were a couple cars in front of us. Clear mike, speedy checkout, nice girls, the correct order, and great-tasting smoothies.  ...  ... We only go to McD's for a few things (parfait, cone, and sometimes the breakfast sandwich) and even then, it's pretty sporadic- maybe a few times a year, because of the lifestyle changes we made since maintaining our weight.


Review 5: OMG you ran out of ice cream too. WTH is going on?? I now that this is the desert and everything but wouldn't that give you even more reason to have ice cream. WTH. Food time here with friends was interesting. We looked outside to check on our car to find that there were a pair of employees making out behind our ride. Hmm. Ok. I guess you are on a break?? Anyways, the food is fine. The prices are a lil more than back home in LA. They have the double filet of fish though. So, that's cool. The hubby bought a disgustingly huge meal here for $21. Of course, we all shared. Had we not, I think he'd still be in food heaven. LOL. The restooms here are nice and clean. That's because you need to be let in to be able to use them. They dont give out tokens or anything. You actally have to be buzzed in. What the hay?! But you know, do what you must to keep it clean. The painting on the wall was awesome. I like that you can check out the old school pins that Mc D's used to have. It's in a glass case next to the soda fountain. Chill, and not too crowded. Gets the job done.


Review 6: I have to strike this fast food venue from my normal few lunch spots for awhile.  The last two visits have been a disappointment.  My french fries were cold both times.  I ordered a Premium Chicken wrap with crispy chicken last week and received grilled chicken.  The receipt had it right so it was the line cooks who got it wrong.  Today I ordered Chicken McNuggets as a combo.  Again and as I said before, cold fries.  And I can guarantee the McNuggets weren't fresh.  I got my food before I even got my change.  It had all been sitting there well before I ordered.  Besides the food, service was terrible.  There was one lady taking orders and she was even making some of the food.  It made for some very slow service during a very busy lunch hour.  Rather than calling out an order or order number when ready, she looked at my boss and said "this is yours."  How rude!  There was a gentelman waiting for his food since before I walked in and was still waiting after I got mine.  His wife took her sandwich back and said it was not fresh.  She got a dirty look from the same rude cashier.  I miss the days of the old manager whom I have not seen in a few months.  He had the staff on their game.


Review 7: I think that the preparation was a tad lacking. I used to work at a Mc D's when I was in high school. It was the perfect job for a kid.  Anyway, my filet was lopsided. It was half way off the bun and my cheese was melted three quarters off the fish. The tartar was every where and my fries were all mushy. I can't expect much from a Mc D's but goodness. There are some interesting folks who come in and out of here. THe awesome thing was that wall of the original Ronald Mc Donald and his lil side kicks. That was cool.


Review 8: I was not impressed with my visit this time to this location. Suprisingly it was by someone who is a shift manager who was working the window. How can you take my order over the speaker and still have a conversation with another employee? It took her several tries to get my order right!! Then when I get to the window she doesn't even say hi or tell me my total just puts her hand out for payment. As I gave her my card I asked her to please give me jelly and extra syrup and butter. All she did was smile when I said thank you. Took them a good 15 minutes to get my stuff as she was a way from window by the inside counters talking to employees. When she finally gave me my order I reasked that I got the jelly and syrup and she goes to reach to get some and then says OH its in the bag.  ... Now I ordered Big Breakfast with Hotcakes and Bacon, two sausage and egg mcmuffins, hashbrown and a coke. When I got home I got everything BUT the HASH Browns!!!! I was to get two of them one with the Big Breakfast and the extra one I ordered. UGGG it was on my receipt. the name on the receipt stated KS #15. So not right especially by someone in Management


Review 9: Went here after work for a quick Mickey D fix. I had order a 6 piece chicken nuggets meal. Sorry to say but I think it will be my last time here. Don't get me wrong, the food tasted fine by my insides didn't think so.


Review 10: Came here because I had to feed my daughter and well, we love McDonald's. So, while waiting for my mom which I dropped her off at Valley Hospital, I decided to go through the drive through. I ordered a kids meal and 2 big mac's with extra sauce, which I got charged extra for and I've never been charged before. There were a few cars in front of me but it went by quick. I pull up to the window for my food and ask the guy at the window which toy they had, as I always do. sad to say he didn't have much but one toy not even the special toy for kids under 3. So I get my food and go. When I get to the hospital I noticed I was not given the apple slices that come with the kids meal. WOW!! and this is why I will NEVER return to this location.


Review 11: Upon my last visit ewww all I can say is ewwww ... These people at this location oh lord baby honey child they just give you cold fries. And old stale chicken nuggets they was hard like little rocks. The soda was missing soda or something it was sour. I wont ever go back to this location.. it smells funny and they looked all shocked when I asked for my money back. The outside of the bag was all wet and sticky ewwww! Thank goodness I carry hand sanitizer.

Review 0: Really it should be 2.5 stars.  They have the dumbest set up for a drive through.  It runs the length of the regular parking area.  If the line for the drive through is long, they block parking spaces and you can't get in nor out!  I ended parking away from the store and walking.   ...  ... Service was fast and polite!  I think I'd skip this place for another McDonald's unless I really needed the coffee or food.


Review 1: When it's busy they shouldn't be using only 1 register, other than that they have an okay customer service.


Review 2: Always busy, food usually cold. Sigh.


Review 3: I totally understand that this is McDonalds and you get for what you pay, but the professionalism here needs major work. While I am waiting for my food, it would be nice not to hear yelling and workers horse-playing behind the register and in front of the store. I thought going inside would be faster since there was a line of cars circling that awful drive thru, but really I think we had waited longer going inside.


Review 4: Understaffed, slow service, coupled with a dirty interior. The trash had been overflowing for at least 20 minutes. The store is far too small for the location.


Review 5: This McDonalds is terrible. I don't expect much from fast food but there is a standard... a low one but at least reach minimal expectations. ...    My son and I went through the drive through (took forever). They have the nerve to ask "is everything on the screen correct".  After we got our food, we pulled forward in the drive-thru to allow traffic to move.  I explained to my son that we need to check and make sure we got everything.... ...    I ordered big Mac meal and happy meal -burger plain. ...    They missed the toy and my fries and his burger... how?  We went inside and had to convince them that we really didn't get everything. They got what we were missing and we went home. ...    My son was disappointed.  I ordered burger plain for a reason.  They were too busy chatting behind the counter to pay attention to the order they already screwed up. No apology. Nothing.  ...    I would let this slide if this was the only time. Hire people that work!  I don't expect a five star meal but get the order right. If not the first time, at least don't screw it up twice!


Review 6: Worst McDonald's by far. It always smells like sewage and the food is alway old. When you tell someone about it's like an inconvenience to them. I can't believe the manager is actually the manager. She has the personality of a rock. There are only a small amount of great employees here.

Review 0: I stopped by for a quick lunch and it took twenty minutes to get my order and was only spoken to in Spanish


Review 1: My mom and I went here for sodas around the night I moved back, they tasted normal. My husband and I got sodas this morning and I cant even describe how awful they tasted! We promptly threw them out and went somewhere else. On top of that the panhandlers and drug addicts asking for money (both times) is ridiculous. Plus, we could barely understand the lady talking through the order box in the drive through. ...  ... Don't go here!


Review 2: We are retired and have gone to this McDonald's since they built it two blocks from our house.  This last year it has gone down hill.  They are out of things often, week after week.   ...  ... The service has become poor.  Some of the long time employees are good but the bad now outweighs the good at that location. ...  ... The street people hitting you up in the drive through and inside but the managers will do nothing about them.  Talked to the owner and he said he would see thing get better but they did not.  ...  ...  After all these years we decided we no longer need McDonald's and have not been in three months.  We have ten grandkids that are not missing it either.  Poor service has cost them a lot when you think about it over the years.

Review 0: Food is good as always. Cool design outside and single golden arches make this a cool spot to hit up after the club or gambling on the strip.


Review 1: I left the Hilton late last night and I was really thirsty.  This was an easy in/out option for me from Sahara.  I did the drive through and was on my way with a Diet Coke in about 2 minutes. ...  ... This is one of the remaining early style McDonald's outlets and there's a classic Chevrolet parallel to the drive through where you can take photos. ...  ... Looking through the windows, I could see the interior is also the classic design.  I'll have to go back and sit inside.  Do I see a Shamrock shake in my near future?


Review 2: 1st to Review-How can this be? A CLASSIC McDonald's @offthestrip at Paradise Rd/Sahara Ave behind the Sahara Casino! ...  ... Coolest thing about this location is their collection of McDonald's Happy Meal Toys and the 50's style look & feel. ...  ... They have a 50's Chevy out front for taking photos. ...  ... Unfortunately the same boring,tasteless food.


Review 3: Out of the thousands of restaurants in Vegas, I had to pick a McDonalds...Well, its a cheap eat. Its right across the Sahara Hotel and its design is like one of those classic type McDonalds back in the 50s, just like Scott D. said below.  ...  ... There is nothing special about it. I had gone through the drive-thru at 11:30pm. I was a little scared since there was people playing music loud and just hanging around suspiciously. I had to wait 5-7 minutes for the lady to get back to me on the speaker. It wasn't even crowded inside. ...  ... Anyways, I ordered 2 McDoubles ($1 each), 2 Hot N' Spicy ($1 each), 2 Bottle Water ($1 each), and 2 Apple Pies (2 for $1), and a Large Iced Tea ($1 each no matter of the size or type of drink). My total was $9.50. ...  ... Nothing special about this place besides the classic car who probably has been waiting for service since forever. Oh well, what can you do in the city of sin?! ...  ... Have Fun here and Keep Yelping!!


Review 4: So I'm not usually one to fuss, pretty laid back so if something bothered me then well....bravo. This mcdonalds isn't in the greatest area, I can't fault the employees for that. I can expect that they get some shady characters and they sometimes you have to handle them a little bit more aggressively. Like tonight, customer causing a minor disturbance and was rude, and the girl which appeared to be a manager of some sort was behind the counter and got upset (naturally of course) she went and handled the customer. Waited for him to come out of the bathroom just waiting there while customers including myself were in line. Ok I get it, go handle the customer, go on with your bad self and handle the shituation. Yes I said shit-u-ation. I get it, go handle the stupid idiot. But when there's a line of customers waiting for service you would think you would get someone to cover you instead us waiting 5 minutes or ATLEAST a simple apology saying "I'm sorry I'll be right with you" instead she was cursing and mumbling under her breath. OH and she proceeded to follow him outside, let it go! He left! So another employee finally started taking orders only after telling me she was already clocked out! Unprofessional. Like come on handle the idiot but don't act like one. Rant over. Oh....and my fries are good.


Review 5: Mixed up order: forgot fries.  Crispy chicken instead of grilled.  Put mayo in sandwich when asked for it on the side. ...  ... Cash only for drive through but accepted credit when dining in...


Review 6: extremely terrible service. They couldn't get my order right the first time, like seriously how hard is it to get a couple sandwiches right!!


Review 7: Grabbed quick breakfast ...service was slow and the dining room was filled with the joyful abundance of homeless and just crazy people of Las Vegas. ... As said before coffee was warm at best, my egg McMuffin without Sausage was cold and greasy!


Review 8: Worst McDonald's ever...tweekers "spare changing" freely, some lady threatened to beat another lady's ass, following her around yelling, dirty drink area, etc. The building looks good, as the only good point. I'll never return to this location if I can avoid it!


Review 9: Worst service and food I have ever experienced at McDonald's l have ever been to. ...  ... Completely wrong order. Ignored at counter when trying to get corrected and even then wrong order and yet again ignored. You would think they would be sensitive on the third time retuning to get a complete order. But no. And then ignored the fourth time when asking to get access to the bathroom.

Review 0: Yo, just ask for the McGangbang.


Review 1: I work in the immediate area of this McDonald's. I use it regularly. ...  This McDonald's is incorporated in a Walmart super center. After 11 a.m., it becomes a mad house. And when the high school lets out in the afternoon, students flood the restaurant. Long lines and waiting on a table are the result. If you do not like crowds that include loud high school students, I recommend avoiding this McDonald's in the late morning to mid afternoon. B.T.W., management has zero tolerance of rowdy behavior. ...    This McDonald's leans toward being a McDonald's Express. So if you want an Egg McMuffin-not here. ...    With a location in a Walmart Super Center the Eastern Beltway Center, it has a high convenience factor. ...    When the restaurant is not congested, it is a comfortable restaurant to eat McDonald's or sip coffee. I never got rushed.


Review 2: I was checking out at Walmart and my two 10 year old daughter went here to ask for a small glass of water with no ice for their puppy and the girl told them that the McDonald was out of water and they could buy bottled water... They dug some of their Allowance they are saving for girl scouts to get some water for their puppy.. Poor service and bad form McDonald's!! I was furious when I got outside and heard this happened...

Review 0: Ahhhh artery clogging McDonalds how I semi like thee! I LOVE their sweet tea, with lemon! Its a deal for only 1 dollar for a large!! Also, their play place is pretty rad! My son likes it anyway... I like it when the mosters actually have socks on! ...  ... I also like the hazelnut iced coffee and love the fries!


Review 1: It's McDonalds.  Always consistent.


Review 2: It feels weird reviewing a McDonalds again, but here we go anyway. Unfortunately I've only had the pleasure of visiting this location after hours and have had different experiences each time.  ...  ... Sometimes they allow me to order select breakfast items off of their 24 hour breakfast menu, and sometimes they don't.  ...  ... Sometimes they allow me to pay with my debit card and sometimes they don't. ...  ... Sometimes the drive thru is open and sometimes the entire restaurant is closed with no warning save for traffic cones blocking the drive thru. ...  ... In case you haven't noticed a pattern, this is the most inconsistent fast food joint I've hit up. And if you do end up ordering some food late at night,  be prepared to take a mini siesta in your car while you wait for your food order.


Review 3: The grease needs to be changed! It's a dark brownish color, I know because it oozed out of the hash browns. @__@ ...  My moms a freak, we all know that, but they pushed her over the edge by not having drinks ready until after the food. It's serving 101, and the Sausage McGriddle is so tiny now! ...  The other McDonalds nearby are much better.


Review 4: We hit the drive-thru for dessert tonight and I was very disappointed. I ordered a snack size M&M McFlurry and a sundae. The McFlurry ended up being vanilla ice cream with M&Ms sprinkled on top. Perhaps children don't notice that laziness but I'm no child and mixing the topping in is the entire point. Lame!


Review 5: Cold food and  cheap night male.manager. You really that hard up for a 20 pc. Nuggets handing out only two packs of BBQ with NO napkinks. Ronalds been NOTIFIED


Review 6: Come on McDonalds, you can do better than that!  Last week I ordered an Egg white Delight and got a regular Egg Mc Muffin, today I ordered an Egg Mc Muffin and Got a Sausage mc muffin with egg. Not sure if they just throw whatever has been sitting there the longest into your bag or what.


Review 7: Gosh I remember when you could go to mcdonalds and get a fairly ok meal for like 3 dollars. Today they like to think of themselves as hip slick and cool pawning off god knows what kinda meat that is. This was the absolute WORST visit I have ever made to McDonalds. I was in a rush wanted to grab something quick as i was already late for a meeting about 1 minute away. I pull up order cant understand a word through the universal translator.I pull up and this kid was on drugs or is a paint huffer on the reg. Takes him about 3 minutes to figure my correct total and order at the window. I pull up wait another 8 minutes and am handed the wrong order. Then I am told to pull around to the front and wait for "fresh" fries. Pull to front,15 minutes later i get out of my car to get my order and it is coming out. I ask for ketchup and pepper,sorry sir we are out of both...WTF? you guys have one job make sure there are basics to accompany that nasty food you serve so i don't feel as though i'm eating a dog shit sandwich. Anyways,I get to my destination sure the fries were lava hot and my big mac was an fing train wreck. Cold,tasted like total crap I suspect it been sitting there since the last ice age. and to complete my abused visit I felt like i was gonna hurl afterwards. Nice going mcdonalds you guys sure have increased you're value and over all quality. i would not serve this slop to my worst enemy that would be inhumane. take a guess when i will return. Oh and what should have taken 5 minutes turned into 30.


Review 8: My coworker got us lunch from this branch and were disgusted with the quality of their fries. We got 4 combos and NONE of us were able to eat it. Sadly we couldn't return them because we had to get back to work DISAPPOINTED because we didn't get to enjoy our fries since they were old/oily/stale/ and plain gross!  ...  ... On a separate visit, I asked the drive though cashier for ketchup and was told that "we are all out" when there was a whole bunch on their counter! I mean, seriously????  ...  ... ZERO STARS, go to a different mcdonalds!


Review 9: No air conditioner! We all sweated as we ate, it's an oven in here!! Worst mc Donald and dinning experience of the summer. How can you have the dinning room open when you have no air and it's over 100 degrees


Review 10: Thank you for wasting my money and time! You guys have me one sausage egg mcmuffin and a sausage mcmuffin for my order of two egg mcmuffins! Didn't even find out about it until after I left! Really guys? How was the order so wrong????


Review 11: Thee most incompetent staff of all time. After I ordered food I remembered I needed a gift card. I asked if I could purchase one and they said they don't take a credit cards--after I just paid with a card. And I asked to order inside and then I'll come in and pay, they said I couldn't. Wth!? What business doesn't want to make money or make their customer happy? And to top it off my order was wrong! Way to try to ruin my day

Review 0: Now that they have upgraded and no longer have face to face, this is my favorite McDonald's in Vegas.


Review 1: This was the first McDonald's in Las Vegas to have the new interior design & WiFi many years ago, when they still charged for it. This location is close to the corner of Sunset and Eastern, which is near the airport runway. The staff is friendly and the manager here knows how to get the customer their order quickly, even when there is a large group of people. This is a good spot to grab a drink or some food before heading over to Sunset Park across the street.


Review 2: Best McDonald's in town. Professional, fast and consistent.  Thats really all you can ask for in a McD's.


Review 3: I eat here a few times a month and since the drive thru kept dumping my drink on me (twice in a month) I started going inside where the service is top notch. Of course today was the first trip to the bathroom where I discovered no paper towels (airblowers) but since I was there to blow my nose. I used a napkin and found no trash can. Im sure thats a price saving measure but I still believe you should have one or you will find all kinds of foreign objects being flushed down the drain. Just a thought guys. Just a thought.


Review 4: Really really nice and friendly staff here.  I've mostly been through the drive-thru, and it's usually the same group of ladies working on Saturday afternoons.  Super nice and they never mess up my order. ...  ... My only issue is the drive-thru layout.  I don't like three windows, and I don't like the face-to-face ordering.  Seems less efficient, takes longer. ...  ... But all in all, good place.


Review 5: The staff is always nice to me. Of course I only know that because the drivethru kept dumping the drinks on me/my car so I started going inside to eat. I figured that was easier than dry cleaning or washing my car. The inside runs well together and handles the occasional freaks with class.


Review 6: Today I ordered small fries. The amount of salt on the fries was tremendous. I would have asked for another order of fries with no salt, but I had seen there were no fresh fries being made at the time as the fry bin was full of those dreadful salt covered fries. I was on my lunch break and I didn't have the time to wait for a fresh batch. I spent around 3 minutes wiping my fries with tissues, desperately trying to get the salt off. Unfortunately this isn't the first time this has happened at this particular restaurant location. I am reluctant to go back anytime soon.


Review 7: I used to go here every morning for breakfast but no more.  This place has the rudest staff I ever encountered, particularly this one supervisor there who is bossing everyone around.  If you like psychodrama and tension in the morning, this is the place.

Review 0: Same old, same old... my GF and I came here because we had the munchies and didn't feel like going into a noisy casino.  They have a sign out front advertising they had Wi-Fi.  But it didn't work.  :(


Review 1: Crappy area, weird parking lot. There's a sign posted that said "merge" to get in to the drive thru. However when I tried to MERGE another customer refused to let me and then hit my brushguard! When I went to see the manager he said I was at fault and although the sign says "MERGE" it really means I should I have yeilded. Really? The sign did't say yield it said MERGE! Between being told my a cranky manager that I can't read, the bad area this is located in, and the aweful parking I opted to head to Del taco in a nicer area instead.


Review 2: Fool me once, shame on you. ...  ... Fools me twice, shame on me. ...  ... Never again. ...  ... This McDonald is absolutely the worst. ...  ... They suck at wait times. ...  ... They suck at customer service. ...  ... They suck at ringing your order up correctly. ...  ... This location is just horrible. ...  ... Never ever in my life will I visit this location again.


Review 3: I waited half an hour in the drive thru @ ... 3 am with only 3 cars ahead of me, and all I wanted was a fucking soda. No apology for the wait, nobody could be bothered to walk it out to me so I didn't have to wait. Ridiculous!


Review 4: If I owned this place, I'd fire every manager, especially the fat ass that works in the morning.   There are five people in line waiting to order and only one person at the counter.  Meanwhile I count 3 managers walking around doing who knows what.  Then this guy comes up to the counter for his free coffee refill so the girl at counter stops taking orders so she can fiddle with the coffee maker.  20 mins to get 2 sausage mcmuffins.  If there was another place on the way to work, I would say screw this place!


Review 5: McDonalds and ATT have a WiFi service arrangement. I had just eaten a late breakfast, but I needed to check my email so my LA ATT.com dsl service add on gives me nationwide free wifi at McD's, Starbucks and many other locations. So, I don't like to go to a place and just use the wifi and not buy anything, so I bought the Angus burger swiss cheese/mushroom and it was okay, 3 stars, but I'm deducting 2 stars for the crappy wifi service... I've used McD's wifi service many times and at this location, I dicked around for nearly an hour and couldn't get it to work... So I bought food I didn't really want and so it was a big waste of time and money. I had to go to Starbucks and they saved my day. ...  ... Hey, I like the Carl's Jr, Big Carl burger better anyway and it's 40% cheaper.


Review 6: Not a very good McD's.  Fountain sodas are flat. Wait times at the drive-thru are ridiculous. Don't bother going inside, it's not any better service. Speak of which, how bout reiterating my order so I don't end up paying for someone else's food.  Disaster avoided! My rating was almost a -2 stars.... ...  ... Re: drive-thru ... Utterly ridiculous. 2 entrances for 1 order terminal/speaker box (right of way madness). Not to mention the horseshoe turn where it's near likely you'll hit some idiot passing through the drive-thru to get inside the McD's...not worth a visit.


Review 7: We got a happy meal with no toy. ... What's the point?! ... And the manager was a prick


Review 8: Worst McDonald's I have ever been to!  ...  ... The area is bad but the employees are just as bad no customer service and just do not care about the customers just themselves and their jokes even the manager acts like a teenager talking about parties and using bad language in front of my child. The food was also not fresh I stopped there since its the closest to my work but I will drive an extra mile and go to the one on Sunset and Eastern WAY more professional and fresh!! Who ever owns this McDonald's has no clue on the behavior of their employees!

Review 0: A nice central McDonald's with ample fountain drink dispensers for the visitors. Be aware of your surroundings here, it attracts a few transient people. The WiFi provided by AT&T sometimes works, just like their cellular reception, so no surprise there. I'm a frequent visitor here to grab drinks & work before visiting hotels. There are quite a few power plugs for laptops inside of the building.


Review 1: If you stay at the Riviera Hotel across the street, you are probably going to stop into this McDonald's for it's Wifi. ...  ... This McDonald's will have long lines late at night for hungry club goers. Sometimes the crazy drunk guests make for some great entertainment as you wait for your order. There will be a sparse amount of homeless, but they don't seem to bother anyone.


Review 2: Approximately, only one register open with 20 drunk people in line. The "pick up here" takes about 15 mins to get your food. The slowest McDonalds I been to. The dinning area isn't as clean. One thing, the restaurant is very trendy and has free wifi. It's right next order to circus circus.. But, your stuck with a bunch of drunk people being very loud and annoying. Be prepare for it!  ...  ... Restroom was very dirty!!


Review 3: Breakfast with a view! ...  ... There really is only one reason for you to go to a McD's on the strip... you're hungry and/or drunk. ...  ... As far as McD's go, this is a pretty nice one! Clean and modern with a lot of staff working all the time. ...  ... This place has one major perk though, you get to watch people misbehaving while they're drunk or on drugs! Seriously, I had a blast!! It started with me arriving while the cops were handcuffing a junkie on the parking lot. The guy was talking to himself and shouting insanely funny random words at people (purple melons anyone?) And that wasn't all! There was a sweet old lady inside (who was definitely schizophrenic) having a lovely conversation with her other selves. And the guy cleaning the mensroom was asleep inside a cubicle with the door open!  ... Loved it!


Review 4: I'm usually very skeptical of fast food joints altogether, ESPECIALLY McDonald's.  ...  ... But I was surprised at the huge size and grand design of the building. Lines were orderly, service was quick, and our food was unusually fresh and neat.  ... And as always, cheap as can be. ...  ... By far the best McDonald's I've been to.  ... There are even TV screens up above that show aquarium video to keep us entertained.


Review 5: Ok ok ok, I know it's only a McDonald's, BUT this one is completely different in decor. It's big, clean, bright and pretty. With tons of flat screens all over the place.  ...  ... Another big plus to this McDonald's is that they've got free Wi-Fi (while most hotels charge ridiculous fees), so if and when you have your laptop you can deal with business while munching on some fries. ...  ... Even though it's smack dab on the strip, there's plenty of parking too!


Review 6: Sometimes, you HAVE to have your McDonald's.  Even when you're in the middle of a culinary Mecca. ...  ... Apparently I'm a sucker for grand openings and press releases blown way out of proportion, because after reading about this new McD's location I made a point to come here during my vacation. ...  ... Probably the nicest McDonald's I've been to, considering there was an employee constantly cleaning and offering to clear customers' trays.  Educational excerpts from the Discovery, Science, and Travel Channels on various flat screen TVs were a nice touch. ...  ... We sat in the middle of the restaurant, on bar stools (surprise, surprise...see my Blueberry Hill review) attached to a huge counter...with fresh flowers!  We were surrounded by the typical plastic booths but I did notice that seating areas near the restrooms offered both club chairs (not sure if they were leather or pleather) and a more private booth section. ...  ... Not much to say about the food since a McNugget here is a McNugget anywhere.  But at least I got my quarterly McD's craving out of the way...


Review 7: We went to McDonalds on our way to Circus Circus. I remember eating at a horrible buffet at Circus Circus and didn't want to go there for breakfast. ...  ... I would avoid this place on the weekends. It was too chaotic we went on a Saturday morning around 11am.  ...  ... We went a second time on a weekday and the lines were more manageable.  ...  ... The workers call your numbers when your order is ready. However, there needs to be a better system. Our number wasn't called and our order was sitting on the counter for 10 minutes. ...  ... Oh well. Cheap breakfast grub.


Review 8: Bof ...


Review 9: Beware of this Mcdonalds. You are constantly under surveillance in the parking lot. I parked my car, had breakfast, and then had to go drop something off to a friend. Within 30 min when I got back, they had my car towed. WTF? It's like they are preying on people's cars. It makes you never want to go to this McDonald's again.


Review 10: Beware! They rip out foreigners. ...  ... I visited there last monday night and had the worst Vegas experience ever.  ...  ... The story is simple. I parked my car in their lot and had some Subway sandwiches at the next door. And got back to the McDonald's getting some deserts.  ...  ... Just after I left the door. My wife and I got shocked. They towed my car. It happened just in 15 minutes. There's a sign saying, "30 minutes parking for McDonald's customers"  I didn't do anything wrong. ...  ... At the impound yard, I met other victims from Germany. They're making money attacking travelers from outside US.


Review 11: Like all other McDonald's, the service quality is going down the tubes.  My son was getting a drink at the drink station when an older guy in his 60's was moping the floor and told me son to "move it" in a very mean and rude voice. ...  ... I went to use the restroom and there was two toilets.  One had a sign on the door that read "Out of service."  The other stall's door would not make a close connection.  I really had to go, but I did not care to have someone walk in on me when I am on the pot.  I tried slamming the door shut, but it would not make a connection.  I told management about it, but they seemed to busy to care of do anything about it.


Review 12: My wife and I went to this location after being at Circus Circus at approximately 10pm a Friday night.  It was busy, but not chaotic. ...  ... You place your order at one end of the counter and pick up at the end of the counter. ...  ... I ordered a Quarter pounder with cheese combo and asked to make it large.  My wife simply ordered a small drink and a McFlurry.  We specifically told the girl we were eating in.   ...  ... When our number was called, our food was in a to go bag.  I was also only given one small cup.  When I asked where my large drink cup was, I was informed that the combo which I paid extra for did not include a drink???? ...  ... The lady was wearing a white shirt and spoke very poor English.  When I showed her my receipt where it said I had paid for a large Combo, she told me I was mistaken.  I then proceeded to go back to the cashier who had rung up my order and ask her what had happened.  She informed me that I should have got a Large cup as well as small cup but the lady in the white was her Manager.  I then asked to speak to another manager.  The cashier then waited until the female manager went in the back and a male manager came up, apologized, and gave me my Large cup.  ?????  He agreed that I was correct and that the cashier had rung up our order correctly but could not give me a reason as to why the female manager would not give me a Large cup.


Review 13: The only reason I came back is because they gave me free food after the fiasco from last night.


Review 14: They are making this the worst Vegas experience  ... towing   ... $300 dollars for 15 minutes  ... Why instead they don't have someone giving information  ... They're making money attacking travelers

Review 0: So what do you get when you are hungry...its 9AM....you only have had 3 hours sleep and you are looking for a homie who was last heard from 3 hours ago....McD's of course!!! ...  ... The sausage egg McMuffin tastes like heaven when you are a bit drunk still, driving down and around the strip. At the OJ and water.....pure re-hydrating goodness!!! The take ATM/Credit at the drive thru and are speedy and attentive when taking your order. ...  ... Oh BTW...the friend I was looking for...he was still in our hotel at the same craps table I left him at!!!!! I actually left the hotel cause I didn't think he would still be down there!! Gotta love Vegas!!


Review 1: This is the most fucked up McDonald's you are gonna see.  Of course I didn't buy anything in here but really like going in there to use their bathroom because it's like negative McMoney for the big McCorporationBucks.com.  They have a shitty parking lot, people reading racing papers in the back, and a depressed Korean woman eating a chicken sandwich in the front.  There's a big old Golden Arches out there with lights all over it, like just regular light bulb lights.  The sign says "new building coming soon" and there are shitty renderings of a new fancy Dallas-style McD's with vegas lights all over it.  I can certainly wait for the new sign and building because I like the old one.  I went in here when I was buzzing on a Full Throttle slurpee which I highly recommend.


Review 2: I was walking down the Strip with relatives from out of town when they commented they were thirsty. At their behest we went into this McDonald's. ...  ... The line was long and ill-managed. Only one register was open despite the 30 or so people in line. ...  ... Most of my companions got their soda right away. One person ordered a coffee, which took 20 minutes to receive.


Review 3: John the manager at this mcdonalds was rude and did not want to provide customer service. In the middle of ordering drive through he refused to accept order. I guess he thinks because he has flashy lights he can do as he likes.  I do not recommend this Mcdonalds.  Take it for what its worth.  Hope you have a better experience than I did.


Review 4: Just having come from a trip at the hotel across the street from this little wonder, I got to speak. ...  ... Night one: About midnight I go in. There are about 5 people waiting in line. Fewer are behind the counter. The lights are on. ... Mister Manager announces "We close for 30 minutes! Order later!".  ... Curious. Rude. Dismissive. ...  ... Night two: The layout of the place makes for poor line control. From S. Las Vegas Blvd. won walks into a box type eating area, then for no good reason the ordering counters swing to an angle. One is challenged as to were the line is, and which line they are in. ...  ... The management staff was rough with staff, and the staff seemingly part of the Clinton Welfare reform failure. ...  ... People working in a McDy's on "The Strip" need a certain group of skills. ... The one's at this McDy's, lacked skills.


Review 5: One star because McDonald's is not food... it's engineered matter that just happens to be edible. But I thought I'd review this McDonald's in particular. It's the last McDonald's I ever ate at. The year was 2004 and in the dark of night, in the cool spring air, my friends and I stumbled out of a casino, drunk from free beer and poor from expensive gambling. It was 5:00 AM and although our appetites were ginormous, our options were limited. We happened upon this McDonald's where they were offering double cheeseburgers for $0.99. I ordered three. My companions followed suit. We sat down among the other customers: three older men sparsely seated and desperate to stay awake lest they be thrown out in the street amongst the crumpled pornographic business cards. One man chewed with his eyes closed. Another bobbed his head up and down. Either he was falling in and out of sleep or agreeing with everything. The last man was not so far gone but was the dirtiest of them all. Once our burgers were consumed, we headed out. I was glad to leave... only sleep lay before me now.


Review 6: remember when i said I never eat at mcdonald's?  I think I did.  I vaguely remember a fried chicken sandwich sometime around 4am.  i think i might have slept in it, which wouldn't have been too bad, since i think it was soggy anyway.  drunk, vegas, and vacation are my excuses and i'm sticking to em


Review 7: Terrible service, plain and simple!


Review 8: This Mcdonalds is not only in the business of making crappy food and providing even crappier service watch out for the racket they have in the parking lot . If your not careful reading the sign at the the front of the entrance it is going to cost you $195.00 in parking fees. went in to to ask the management they just blew me off. lucky they are in vegas where they dont count on repeat businesssss.

Review 0: Yay...polite and very fast for a busy mcdonalds.


Review 1: Yes, I went to a McDonald's while in Vegas.  I even went twice *gasp*  ...  ... The first time was because my friend and I felt that we had lost enough at the blackjack table, so we went to McD's to drown our sorrows in some milkshakes and McFlurries while practicing with a deck of card and some nickels. ...  ... The second time was because we hadn't eaten lunch, but we knew we wouldn't be able to make it until dinner :)  So we stopped really quickly for some fries...and more McFlurries ;) ...  ... The service isn't the quickest, but they are friendly and the food is good!  Stop in for a quick treat!


Review 2: These people here are retards. Caught them overcharging my friend for his senior coffee. Then they got my order of two coffees wrong three times in a row. Dude was a punk too shaking his head and acting like a jerk. I think life's gonna be a long road for him.

Review 0: I know, really, I'm writing a review of McDonald's? Well, there is a good reason. I always pass this McDonald's when I work at a convention on the strip. It's just on my way. I do not eat a whole lot of McDonald's, but sometimes those Golden Arches just call to you. ...  ... Usually when I am on my way to work it is early morning and I have just run out of the door and I haven't eaten anything. I tend to swing through this McDonald's through the drive-thru. Usually I just get a coffee (I do have an affinity for their coffee btw), but sometimes I get the breakfast burritos. I won't lie, I'm addicted to these things. Um, I'm not even sure what is really in them, but I really don't care. ...  ... Anyway, my experience with their drive-thru staff is always awesome. When it is early in the morning and the McDonald's employees are still being really nice and happy I think that is a good thing. So props to this Mickey D's, you've earned my admiration even if you are a fast food establishment!


Review 1: This location has always been a bit seedy. I guess they have problems with the homeless trashing their bathrooms because they make you ask to use tge bathroom & then buzz you in which is extremely inconvenient when you have toddlers who can open the door from the inside.  ...  ... The service was friendly enough, but the guy didnt have change, and though i ordered (and paid for) extra ranch, it didnt come with my meal.  ...  ... The kids area has been recently renovated. I cant say its an improvement. They took away the toddler slide area to add more seating. They didnt add that much more seating, and i miss the toddler slide for my kids.  ...  ... This location is also homeless central. There are always three or four ppl begging on the corner, and often asking for change when you walk in or out. While I dont mind giving to those less fortunate than myself, i dont like being accosted by an army of them like a zombie apocalypse.  ...  ... Three stars. Would be less except the play area looks like a big tree house , which thrilled my kids.


Review 2: This location is consistent with being inconsistent. ...  ... I frequent this location because it is close to my house. ONLY REASON. ...  ... I pretty much order the same thing every time: ...  ... 4 piece chicken nugget happy meal, ranch for my dip, for a boy and a apple juice.  ... Absolutely nothing special. ...  ... Yet, every time they forget something. One day it is the fries, next it will be his toy, some days it is the sliced apples.  ...  ... So I have to make sure I check my order every time before I leave the drive thru window. ...  ... And the inside is always dirty. Always.


Review 3: Sucks! Seriously they take cc thru the drive thru but not inside! Wth!!! There is absolutely no logic in that so after I ordered and tried to pay I was refused (even though I go thru the drive thru all the time! So I pointed out there was no signs anywhere saying that and they still refused. So I took my crew down to the one on boulder highway (where we ordered the same thing and it was cheaper) and paid inside with a card!

Review 0: Dear McDonalds Corporate. The franchisee running this McD location needs to be recalled to Hamburger University and retrained on how to run their franchise properly. This location fails on so many things. Start by teaching the staff to listen to a customer's order. Follow up by teaching them the importance of order accuracy over sheer speed. Train the staff to give the customer options if something is not available. And last but certainly not least spend some money to make sure your basic equipment works correctly. For example if you're a McCafe location and every time someone rolls up to your drive thru and they can't order anything, you're really not a McCafe location at all.  ...  ... In short most of the problems at this McDonalds can be traced back to MANAGEMENT FAILURE. Someone needs to extract their head from their derriere and run this location the way it's supposed to be run. 2 Stars and a complaint to McD Corporate in Illinois is the best I can give this place.


Review 1: I am so sorry to have to do this, I do feel that if you can't say anything nice, ... well, you know ... so I don't.  But this restaurant is awful, despite the fact that they just remodeled.  I tried it a month ago because I wanted to try the 1/3 angus burger and see what that was all about.  The burger was "okay", but it was almost necessary to run a gauntlet to get it.  Right next to the front door, they had a full, full garbage can, and the stench was horrible - right next to the front door.  And then, I kid you not, I had to walk through a swarm of flies on my way to the front counter.  NOT appetizing.  I mentioned this to friends who said call the health dept., but I'm not going to do that to someone unless I see poisoned people in the aisles, let someone else do it if they want.  The reason I'm compelled to write is that I wanted to try another product (this is really close to my house), a chicken biscuit to compare to one I had in St. Louis to see if there were any decent biscuits here and McD's advertises this all the time - the biscuit was overcooked and horrible and the chicken was burnt.  I wasn't going in after the first experience, but I figured the drive through would be okay. The first window where they take the money was "womanned" by what seemed to be the manager, she was beyond rude.  The take out window girl was nicer, at least she smiled.  There are a lot of nice nice people at McDonalds, and a few have better food, but not this one!  Again, sorry...


Review 2: I would give this place a 0-star review if I could! I swung by with my son (autistic ADHD/severe-anxiety), and my cousin while on our way home from job-hunting. ...  ... 1. First off the cashier serving us--I had to repeat parts of the order a few times, he repeated some way wrong, then he repeated the whole thing and I heard burger in part of the order (wow this place was noisy, too), so I thought he finally got it right and I was tired of how long it took to order a burger for my son who's very particular about what he gets (was ordering as a reward for being good), and get myself and my cousin a couple spicy chickens. ...  ... 2. The guy didn't give us our soda cups, IT TOOK COMPLAINING TO ANOTHER PERSON TO GET SOMEONE TO GIVE US THE CUPS FOR THE SODAS WE BOUGHT!! (Thank you, miss!) And we weren't the only customers he wasn't giving cups to, might I add! ...  ... 3. We walked to the table to get out of the way and I looked everything over to make sure it was right...Spicy Mc Chicken instead of a burger. So I thought, they're busy, I'd ask if my son wanted to try a chicken sammich, he was fine if I scraped everything off. Someone who was working here said its not necessary and she'd get what he ordered. (Another nice lady!) ...  ... 4. The cashier came to our table and started ARGUING WITH US, walked away and asked (a manager? I couldn't see), then came back and said "We'll have to charge you to get what you wanted", when all they had to do was replace the $1 Mc Chicken with a $1 burger with only ketchup on it. Other McD's have made the simple swap without hassle when they've messed up, although mess-ups have still been rare and except for this McD, those cashiers didn't try to pin the blame on the customer! ...  ... End of it: I simply told him that he can forget about that, that we weren't going to pay extra to buy another item because HE messed up, and none of us are ever eating here again. Some other McD's can get our money. ...  ... Putting smiles on kids' faces, huh? Yeah right. ...  ...  ... EDIT: Oh, and we didn't get our receipt back, so I can't exactly take it straight to the store manager. But we did get names.

Review 0: It is McDonald's what else can you say.


Review 1: Finally left early enough for work to allow me to get a McD's coffee. I don't like the fancy coffees, just regular coffee with cream. I decided to be quick, avoid the drive-thru and go inside. My luck there was one person ahead of me, while there were at least 5 cars waiting outside. I liked the counter displays. They were a variety of coffee cups and mugs presented in such a way as to look inviting. I thought it was a nice touch.  ...  Well, my turn came and I realized just how slow the cashier was. It was as if she had not a care Umbria world. After a few moments she finally took my order. Another woman actually made my coffee quickly, and I was headed to work. My disappointment came when I realized that the coffee tasted bitter. Burnt. Ugh. I will try another McD's closer to work next time. What a let down.


Review 2: While seeing my food sit at the drive through window, I watched as the lady preferred to attend the coffee maker and then after taking her time I finally got my food as she handed me the food waiting at the window.... I could have left way before that! My fries suck and the nuggets are rock hard!


Review 3: Second time I have gone through Drive-Thru and ordered Chicken Nuggets for my nephew.  They always forget the sauce.  Called to let them know it has happened twice.  The girl on the other end of the line said to check before I leave that it's in there.   I am paying for a product and checking to see that someone else has done their job.  Sad.

Review 0: Fairly new building so modern with plenty of room. Lots of windows so lots of light. Kept clean.


Review 1: Friendly staff. I miss McDonalds. Stupid diet. I snuck in and had a double cheeseburger. Don't tell my wife.


Review 2: The food is ok(for Mcdonalds), but the service is some of the worst I have ever received at any Mcdonalds, They are also out of everything, and I have been ignored the two times I have been in there, Horrible service.  Hopefully this is due to being a new store and they work some of this out.


Review 3: This "new" location is worse than the one that closed down, down the street. The other day I asked for a McCrib & the drive thru attendant went on and on about how they don't have it till next week & that it isn't real meat & it doesn't have real BBQ sauce & questioned me why I would want that sandwich to begin with! I came back the next day & a different drive thru attendant was equally rude! If I could, I would give them zero stars.

Review 0: An "A-OK" McDonalds... if you're leaving the Strip and need to stop by McDonalds for some breakfast (or quick lunch/dinner), this is a decent place to stop by. The seating is a bit strange as they've replaced the normal tables and benches with what looks to be an attempt for a more modern look... but it makes the seating a bit uncomfortable. The food tastes like standard McDonald's food and the staff were generally nice.


Review 1: Came here on a short re-feul from gambling all night/morning - breakfast never tasted so good (that I can remember). ...  ... Bottomline: it seemed pretty clean in here. It's a McDonald's.


Review 2: Typical McDonald's.  I like this location because it is an easy to get just off the strip location.  It is perfect for a quick inexpensive breakfast.  Drive-thru is on pair with most "quick drive-thru's".  Interior is Harley-Davidson themed for those that like to look at things while they wait for food.


Review 3: Rude staff and cold fries! I would have given one star but the inside looks nice. Modern and clean. My friend was told she could get iced coffee with her meal with no extra charge then was charged $1 extra.


Review 4: Sad to say, I have seen worse.  It's convenient and relatively fast. Just not clean as it could be. ...  ... The staff here are almost as depressed as the homeless people you find hanging around it


Review 5: McDonalds has not the best reputation but this has been the worst fast food experience of my lifetime. ...  ... Besides waiting 20 minutes for a Big Mac, I witnessed a customer treatening to hit a member of staff. I am not sure what happened as I only arrived when the customer said he would "hit him later" and then left. ...  ... Then staff members began shouting at each other about using each other's cashier machines.  ...  ... It was so obvious that the staff were untrained and completely unprofessional. The manager seemed to have lost control and was berating staff in front of other customers.


Review 6: The worst McD's EVER!  Took 20 min for 2 coffees, & they couldn't get it right.  Everything about it was bad, slow, irritating.


Review 7: Very slow taking the order and giving me the order when it was done. It was the middle of the night and a few people there.

Review 0: drunk fools at 5:30 am and the staff is going strong as the cashier announces "ladies and gentleman, we'll be changing to our breakfast menu in 30 minutes!"


Review 1: This is the best Mickey D's I have ever frequented! They have tables with flowers! The food looks perfect, like it's straight out of the commercial. Plus, I got coffee & a waitress actually walked around the place refilling peoples coffee, like a diner. Wholly sugar balls! That's classy.


Review 2: McDonalds is McDonalds.. Great meal on the strip for a great price. Escalator didn't work so we weren't able to bring our luggage. But good for what you get. Plus really fresh cold water!


Review 3: Ok, what in the world is going on with people giving this particular McDonald's up to 5 Stars, you may ask?? ...  ... I'm glad you asked that!     :-)) ...  ... There are several McDonald's on the Strip, & this one is across the street from Caesar's Palace, & adjacent to Harrah's.  It starts outside, on the second floor. ...  ... *  There's a nice patio area out in front of the doors. ...  ... *  Inside, it's nothing short of beautiful for a McDonalds!  The dining room is stylish, & comfortable, & if it's full, which is somewhat likely, there's a nice upstairs, inside balcony.  Don't fail to look up at the awesome ceiling, either.  The Sistine Chapel has nothing on THIS place!!  Ok, it's not quite THAT nice.     :-) ...  ... *  The prices are regular McDonald's prices, CHEAP! ...  ... *  The service is perky & friendly. ...  ... *  If the "people watching" is great in Vegas, it's STELLAR in this place!  ...& it doesn't have to be 3 in the morning either, although I believe the other reviewers that it's stellar on steroids at THAT time of night!!     :-) ...  ... *  Free Wi-Fi! ...  ... A couple of little negatives cost them a Star from me: ...  ... *  The escalator wasn't operative during my several visits here over 3 days. ...  ... *  The custom in here is to wait in one line for the next available counter person, but some people don't get it & take cuts.  Management should spell out specifically how you're supposed to wait, in this super busy restaurant. ...  ... World's best McDonald's?  Could be!     :-)) ...  ... McDouble Cheeseburger & a Sr. Coffee:  $1.59!!


Review 4: Up in early AM, and need a quick bite? I frequented this McD's for the $1 breakfast menu (gotta save the $ for gambling!) and there's always a ton of people since it's open 24 hours. Ride the escalator up and although there's a lot of people, it's organized and food comes out shortly after you order. Satisfied my morning cravings as always.


Review 5: 3 stars for hot n spicy McChickens.


Review 6: 3 stars for the hot and spicy mcchicken and free wifi. ...  ... -Service sucked. ... -Dining area was filthy. ... -The guy moping the floor didnt know how to ring out a mop right. ...  ... They have a number on receipts for customers so they know which order they are. The guy calling out customer's orders wasnt even calling out numbers he was saying the items on a customers order. The people waiting right next to me were confused because some of them also ordered the same thing I did. Most of the staff looked like they didnt really give a damn about their job. I wouldnt give a damn neither if I was working at a McDonalds at 3am in the morning.


Review 7: Being Vegas and all restaurants assuming you just hit the mega-millions jackpot, it's nice to see some lower priced food ON the Strip. There's definitely better food out there, but in a bind, not so bad. It was over 100 degrees today so I came in for a cone. Again, not a terrible place to take a load off... but I'd suggest hanging out in a shopping area (i.e. the Forum or Palazzo Shoppes) if you'd like to just sit to wait for someone. This McDonald's can get quite busy and crowded. ...  ... With that said, it's what you would expect. Fast food. Nothing special about this particular location.


Review 8: C'est pas un Macdo, c'est la bourse de New York, enfin Vegas.... ... A 9h du mat, a crie dans tous les sens le nom des commandes. Il y a mme des employs qui vous acceuillent et vous dirigent vers les files d'attentes. ... Rendement maximal oblige. ... Le Macdo du Strip reste cependant l'une des meilleures options pour un petit dej pas cher et rapide.


Review 9: Fairly clean, bit slow service, but free refills and free WiFi - the latter a $12 value!


Review 10: I strongly recommend only eating here if your hotel is close enough for you to take the food back there to eat it. It's ridiculously loud inside, and the patio tables outside are covered with pigeon droppings (didn't stop anyone from eating out there, which blew my mind) Service and food is standard McD's of course, but consider it to-go only.


Review 11: It's a very unique and very conveniently located McDonald's. Almost seems as it is part of the same building as Harrah's. Although they are really open 24/7, their entire menu is not available at all times. In my opinion and I love their breakfast most of all, they switch way too early in the morning. A few nights it was 4:00 a.m. on other nights by 3:30 a.m they had already switched to breakfast. During weekdays you will have no problem finding a table for yourself and your family. On the weekends, however, good luck. There is seating upstairs, downstairs and outside. Still was difficult to find a table for just myself on the weekend. Primarily in the morning. Other than the cool arch, it's your typical McDonald's. If this location isn't close to your hotel, fret not my dear friend on a budget, there is literally a McDonald's everywhere on The Strip.


Review 12: Quick place to grab a cheap bite to eat no matter what time of day it is. The lines can get pretty long so bring your patience. The staff has always been friendly and with all the customers they see in a day that's amazing. They also have free wifi which is nice because all the surrounding Caesar's properties charge for it.


Review 13: You would think that McDonald's on the Vegas strip would know what their customers want at 3AM in the morning. Unfortunately they do not. For some reason this McDonald's did not have a late night menu. They switch to a breakfast only menu way to early in the night!


Review 14: The food is good however the service is not the best... Be VERY specific and talk slow when you order. Seriously.  ... I ordered a mcdouble with cheese and mayo only. And got a slice of cheese with mayonnaise no meat. :/ other than that food is good cheap fast and convenient. Especially if you work nearby!


Review 15: The food was pretty average. The place was rather dimly lit. The establishment itself wasn't very clean. The floors were sticky, especially near the soda machines. ...  ... Not sure what else to say, except I guess at wee hours of the night, it's a familiar place to go.


Review 16: This review is only for the strawberry milkshake.  ...  ... We stumbled into this mcdonalds because the girlfriend had a sudden craving for Mickey d strawberry milkshake. When we got it, the presentation was ok, but the taste....there was a terrible artificial taste to it, almost as if it was made with 90% stevia and 10% milk.  ... 2 stars, since the shake itself looked (misleadingly) decent.


Review 17: Horrible service... Wait for food is 20 min. I know it's just McDonalds but this is crazy. If they actually had to compete for business they would fail...


Review 18: I can't believe the nasty and ghetto things occurring at this store.  Wear gloves!! I wouldn't recommend you walk away from this micky D's


Review 19: Make sure to double check your order! I didn't get any sauce with my McNuggets even though it was on the receipt.  I only realized it after I got back to my hotel room. ...  ... Also, they didn't ask if I wanted pie. They are supposed to ask you; otherwise  you are entitled to a free one.  I didn't want to cause trouble, but it's obvious that the customer service is lacking when people stop by from the clubs.


Review 20: OMG never had such a shitty burger ( bbq ranch burger) threw up in my mouth: always have loved mcdonalds 4-5 stars but have to review that shit (literally would probably eat shit) than eat the bbq ranch burger!


Review 21: They tried to steal money from me!  Coming right from an ATM, all I had was $20 bills. I ordered $8.90 worth of food and the casheer gave me $1.10 back. He claimed that I gave him $10. When I said no, he made a loud fuss, had someone come by and said that the manager was going to count the drawer and see if there was extra money. After about 15 minutes, someone came back and said that the drawer had the right amount of money in it. I said I wanted to speak to the manager and they said ok. The manager never came out, but a large black man (that had been talking previously to the cashier) told me about a story where someone made a "big deal out of nothing and one person went crazy on that person". I assumed that he was talking about me and my missing $10, so I asked him what he was here for and if he was going to buy anything. After another 15 minutes, the came out and told me that they had recounted and realized that they were $10 over. They then gave me my money. The cashier made a condescending remark to me and I left. I believe his name was Lorenzo.

Review 0: This is a good McDonalds it is usually pretty busy though, inside is nice and well kept, it's actually one of the nicer interiors of a McDonalds that I have seen In the valley.  The drive through is usually pretty busy due to the layout but its usually quick.  The food I get is good and if you haven't tried it get a McDouble with Big Mac sauce, i highly recommend it, it's excellent!!!


Review 1: First of all let me say that this McDonalds doesn't have a sign in their drive thru stating that they charge for Ranch.  ... Second of all customer service sucks here. I know that you can't expect them to treat super great but at least have respect. The stupid cashier at the 2nd window was Rude about me asking for ranch then got her manager which wasn't that nice either. ... Third of all when I get home, my order is missing! I was missing one of our burgers.  ... Then I try to call them but no answer. Why do they have a phone if they won't answer? So guess what store#18966 I call the 800 number and did a complaint. Hope you learn to have respect, I'm not asking for u to all happy and jolly JUST RESPECT! ... Forgot to mention that my husband's fries where half way full! What's wrong with them!


Review 2: I've here tons of times per month for the last 6 mos.... took my business to this location after a nearby Mc D's kept screwing up and giving me the wrong order entirely every time, including giving me diet soda. ...  ... Today is like the third time in the last 2 weeks that I've ordered a DR PEPPER and got a DIET COKE, which I'm incredibly allergic to! Thanks for not taking the time to be careful of giving people something they didn't order! Maybe you guys need to be educated about artificial sweetener (which diet is worse for you than regular btw, readers) being a major 'food' allergy, before someone gets a lawyer. If it was my grandpa we were just getting a soda for, he'd be in the hospital right about now. ...  ... Thanks guys for making my insides burn for the next several hours!! I really (DON'T) appreciate it!!!!!

Review 0: I agree with Douglas--this is one of the best McDonald's in Las Vegas.  I stopped here for a quick ice cream last night and I was immediately impressed with the newness and nice design of the place. ...  ... The staff took my order quickly, and I was on my way to a table very quickly.  The tables were clean and the restaurant was clean.  I was really impressed! ...  ... They have free wifi which is a nice bonus.  If I need at break some day and I'm in the area, I'll definitely stop again.


Review 1: One of best McDonalds in Vegas, always very clean,, great service ,, close to the Las Vegas Strip...


Review 2: I am not a fan of fast food. But sometimes a girls gotta eat late! I came here after my LONG flight from Honolulu and I was pretty darn hungry.  ...  ... They were out of Southwest salads, but the bacon chicken wasn't bad. The salad was still fresh and the chicken was warm. I would go back if I ever had a late night McCraving!


Review 3: I'LL HAVE ONE BREAKFAST MCMUFFIN, HOLD THE GUNFIRE ...  ... If you're in Vegas for an event at the Convention Center, you'll probably be up early enough for breakfast. If you're not there on work, you might just want to sleep through this part of the day. McDonald's breakfast is not sold nearly long enough. I never make it there on time! How hard would it be to serve eggs all day?!!  In any case, this McD's is convenient to the convention center. ...  ... We stopped here more than once on our last Vegas trip a couple months back. On one of the visits while dining in, we noticed a bullet hole in the window from the night before. Someone probably mad about breakfast not being served all day is my guess. ...  ... Service was good. Food was average. The coolest thing about this location was the deco. It was so modern inside. Clean and cool. I like that.


Review 4: So I love McDonald's breakfast and we were on our way to the convention center for the Heli-Expo and I ordered my usual of one bacon egg and cheese biscuit, and one bacon egg and cheese McGriddle and they were great as usual.  The service was also quick and good. I don't understand the people that complain about the service or food from McDonald's what do you really expect.  Go somewhere else if you want better service, or literally go anywhere else but don't complain you know what you are getting yourself into.   ...  ... After we sat down and got our food we noticed that one of the huge front windows was completely shattered.  It actually looked really neat and then we asked what happened they said that someone shot it the night before.    ...  ... The other nice thing about this McDonald's is it has free Wi-Fi for all of its customers.


Review 5: This McDonald's is located just a couple of blocks from the hotel I stayed at in Las Vegas - an Embassy Suites Hilton property - therefore it is within walking distance (There does not appear to be many businesses within walking distance of this hotel). ...  ... Had a late lunch here around 2:00 pm.  Ordered the #3 value meal: Quarter Pounder w/ cheese, medium fries and lemonade. ...  ... Meal came up promptly, was hot, not greasy, fries were crisp - all was good! ...  ... Interesting note: in order to use the restrooms - you have to let them know at the counter - and then they buzz you in - no physical key. Makes me wonder about the status of the surrounding neighborhood! ...  ... There is also a large red DVD rental machine in the dining area of this Mickey D's.


Review 6: Cold terrible cardboard on a bun, trashy service, homeless people drinking 24oz cans of Natural Ice inside the place!


Review 7: I'm a Mclover, and I had no problem ... with the workers. But I have a problem waiting more than 30 minutes for my cheeseburger. They weren't even busy! This was my first and last time at this location.


Review 8: Please people if you are looking for a "fast food" to eat do not go to this place. 15 minute for a simple double cheese burger. Employees work slower then my grandma.


Review 9: The service here was terrible. They got my breakfast order wrong three times, each time with the same exact mistake. The morning  cashier there, dalia, didn't even attempt to move a muscle to get me the right order. Food is just like any other mcdonalds, service was the worst. There's 50 others you can go to within a mile anyway


Review 10: Truly disgusting place.


Review 11: Was told at 5am that burgers arent made until 4pm by some chubby ogre latina. ...  ... Stay in school kids.


Review 12: Went here to get some cookies for a friend. The drive thru person Lamoni, sucked and couldn't tell the difference from coffee to her asshole, also a car broke down in the drive thru.

Review 0: It's Vegas. People are already walking outside. It's kinda crowded and it's only about 830AM. I was hesitant to see all the people standing inside but I needed to get something quick and simple for my boyfriend. ...  ... Let me tell you; I was in/out in maybe 5 minutes tops! I ordered two egg white breakfast sandwiches, two large orange juices, and a side order of pancakes. I ordered, walked off to go stand in a corner and my order was ready! I was blown away! ...  ... Staff are quick, efficient, and on-point. Kudos to all these employees for working so hard and fast to cater to everyone down here!


Review 1: Great place to stop in for a late night snack and escape the high prices of the strip.  It was very crowded when I went, but true to the fast food industry name, my order came out very quick.


Review 2: In the three days I was in Vegas I went to Mc Donalds five times. Four out of the five times was at this location. I told myself that I would not go to Mc Dinalds but I have to admit how handy this place was. Sometimes when your drunk and hungry a fifthteen dollar burger isnt going to cut it, sometimes you just need a dollar menu. Great location. Get filled up for less here.


Review 3: The Las Vegas Strip is the adult Disney Land. And the majority of restaurants charge Disney Land prices for food. When I want to save money on the Strip, I will visit a fast food restaurant. Last night, I tried the newest McDonald's on the Strip. ...  ...    This McDonald's opened a few weeks after the Harmon Road pedestrian overpass. It is located at the lower right corner of the new mall that went up at the northeast corner of Las Vegas Boulevard and Harmon Road, below the new Harmon Road pedestrian bridge. It is a modern two-story McDonald's that would fit in at Midtown Manhattan. In contrast to the McDonald's about a block away the outside is more low key. Instead of giant arches there is only an "M." With the exception of somebody asking me for change (expected on the Strip) it felt like I was eating in a classy fast food restaurant. The interior is modernism and everything is new. ...  ...  Kudos to McDonald's for keeping that price relative to the off strip locations. in my opinion paying approximately $8 for a ranch BLT value meal large size is worth it.  ...  ...    With restaurants on the Las Vegas Strip charging Disney Land prices, sometimes McDonald's will do. I see myself returning to the newest McDonald's on the Strip.


Review 4: YES, the Strip needed another McDonalds, as the ones above this one (3475) & just below it (3755) are SO busy all the time!  This lovely new location is tucked around the corner from a very popular Walgreen's, on the corner of Las Vegas Bv. & Harmon, but isn't crowded, as the the throngs haven't discovered it yet.  What you get here is fast little or no line service in a stylish, up to the minute 2-story location with a friendly staff, out-of-the-way corner tables available to tuck yourself away in downstairs if you like, or your choice of stairs or an elevator to take you up to the second floor dining room. ...  ... The only drawback I could come up with for this new location is that if you're a guy using the urinal, your hardware is right out in public whenever anyone opens the door, as there's no partition between you & the hallway, & no lock on the door.  Whatever...  this is Vegas!     :-)) ...  ... 4 Stars for this nice brand new McDonalds!


Review 5: Staff was friendly for a McDonalds and food was quick since most ingredients were precooked.  However, the southern chicken biscuit was precooked so much it was disgustingly dry.  The patty was tough and chewy.  Yuck!


Review 6: This is probably the worst McDonald's I've been to.


Review 7: Worst McDonalds that I have ever been to. Weird and rude staff. I don't know who, in the god's name, hired them.

Review 0: "Can't believe I'm rating a fast food joint..." ...  ... This review is for rating McDonalds only! ...  ... I'm not positive why California McDonalds cannot be like this one.  I'm not sure if it's like all of this throughout Las Vegas, but this is one sure delicious McDonalds.  This is because one item on there dollar menu.  I do not care this is fast food!  I live off this for the whole Halloween weekend.  This and cranberry and pomegranate juice. ...  ... No need for fancy buffets, when the Hot N Spicy comes as a luxury because it's not served in California.  Yes, they actually use the word spicy correct in a restaurant.  Because this sandwich did have a kick to it.  Here in the states, usually when it says spicy - the word spicy usually means American spicy.  American spicy is like a Asian person's mild.  This had an Asian kick of mild/spicy. ...  ... Now lets talk about the crisp.  The crisp of this sandwich was definitely there.  Every single bite, was a crunch, crunch, and crunch.  Hot steamy buns, tossed with some mayo and lettuce and I was set.  This was just goodness coming out of fast food. ...  ... If you like the McChicken, and you like spice... This is the perfect sandwich for you.  No need to go home and add saracha.  You will get the spice built into the batter. Just chomp chomp and chomp.  And be satisfied.


Review 1: 'only in vegas" was what i said to stacy's mom in car next to us when she asked 'bout our 50pc mcnuggets happy meal lookalike box. ...  ... they're 24/7. and this definitely beats those after hours steak and eggs. maybe? ...  ... and only in vegas where manager treats their nuggets like gold. he yelled at his cashier when she didnt answer his repeated question "is this theirs? hey is it really theirs?" yes i did remind him


Review 2: 50 piece nuggets for $9.99 and $0.50 cones?! ...  ... Only in Vegas! This is the perfect greasy food for your hangover cure!


Review 3: FIVE STARS, THREE WORDS: ...  ... HOT N SPICY! ...  ... The only reason we came here was in search of the holy grail McChicken, the Hot N Spicy. We heard about it from some randoms, and we had never heard of it so went to check it out. It was tucked away in a corner, so it was never packed, always clean and had quick service. Why do they not have these in California? I'll never know, but I'll definitely hit this spot back up for late night drunken eats!


Review 4: Go to McDonalds to get what you expect. Cheapest meal on the strip. Split the 20 piece nuggets with my mom and got two double cheeseburgers (which we didn't even eat, hello breakfast!) for $7! wouldn't be so excited normally but paying upwards of $30 a person made me really appreciate what McDonalds has to offer. For $5 more, this one offers 2 complete meals. Go here for a cheap meal anytime.


Review 5: Ok so I'm 10 years old.... AND my friend John takes me here like.... EVERY week so.... I always get the 6 pc. Chicken nugget kids meal with sweet n sour sauce AND WHAT DO I GET FOR A DRINK? Lemonade. If you have a child, get them the kids meal! MCDONALDS IS SOOOO DELICIOUS! THE BEST FOOD EVER!!!!!


Review 6: only went there after 4am and the was ridulous! thats wassup!


Review 7: The only two reasons I would review a fast food restaurant are good or bad service experiences. I had a great experience here. I ordered two Spicy McChickens (wish they had this in CA), 10 McNuggets, and fries. Since I had to wait a long time for my order, however, I received a bunch of freebies that I didn't even ask for: a large soft drink, 10 more McNuggets, and another Spicy McChicken. Hehe I love these victories.


Review 8: This is one of the best McDonalds I've been to. It has been remodeled in the past few years, so it looks nice and it is kept clean as well. This was a great place for my sister and I to sit and cool off and get ice cream while the adults were playing a game downstairs. I think it was more than the McDonald's in my area (I think...), but it was well worth it-I saw it as paying a couple of extra cents to sit in an air conditioned place on a hot summer day.


Review 9: This place was an oasis. A mirage that turned out to be real. We walked for what seemed like hours in the blistering Vegas wind. Trudging slowly, like two novice drinkers, deprived of water weight and nourishment.  ...  ... Once we arrived it felt just like McDonalds at home. +1 smelly bum that sat behind us. Hey, bums gotta sit too. But man he was smelly. ...  ... We got breakfast there and were able to gamble playing Monopoly at the same time. We won another breakfast sandwich. I love McDonalds.


Review 10: You MUST try this place if you come to Vegas!  First, the burgers are awesome, whether you get the regular hamburger or the huge quarter pounder, they are juicy and delicious and prepared exactly as you want them. They cook them in advance so you don't have to wait very long.  ...  ... I ordered their specialty burger, which is called the Big Mac, boy does the name fit. It comes with two all beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions, all on a sesame seed bun. Simply amazing.  ...  ... You should also get their fried potatoes, which are called French Fries. Not sure what is French about them, but they sure are delicious, especially with the tomato based dipping sauce.  ...  ... They have a fried fish sandwich which features a tender and moist fillet of locally caught cod. You can get it with or without cheese.  ...  ... I haven't tried everything on the menu yet, but I recommend ordering one of their creatively packaged combo deals. They all come with the main sandwich, French Fries, and a drink. You can get a soft drink or one of their delicious milk shakes.  I am pretty sure they are made with hand scooped ice cream.  ...  ... I will be sure to return to this restaurant next time I find myself on the Las Vegas strip and  want what is possibly the best dining experience around.


Review 11: After a good night at the club me and my friends wanted to grab some grub before we knocked out for the next day. We went to club Pure that night so what did we see across the street? A huge ass M which meant food so we were there.  ...  ... So i guess it's a 24 hour McDonalds and i would honestly hate to work there because you are guaranteed to get drunk people every night. One of the employee's job was to make sure no one brought alcoholic drinks inside the restaurant which i have to say sucks.  ...  ... It was around 2:30am and the lines were pretty long. I guess everyone had the same idea as we did. It took kind of long since some of the drunk people in front of us could hardly function, but it was understandable. Annoying, but understandable. So i finally ordered my food and had a wait for a while because they were busy.  ...  ... Since we were staying at Treasure Island we figured we could just walk down that way and cross there. Apparently i was too drunk to realize and totally forgot that you can only cross at the Harrahs, or all the way down at the Encore. So we headed toward the Encore and we had to back track a couple of blocks. We could have just gone back to the Harrahs and crossed and save about 10-15 mins..but whatevs...  ...  ... Anyways, it was clean, legit, and you get to take an escalator to get to the restaurant. How fun when you are drunk!


Review 12: I definitely needed a snack because i was drunk and there would be no time for dinner. Since I'm already spending all my money on drinking and gambling, I decided to go cheap on the meal so dollar menu it is. We go to the McDonalds on the strip with the Big Golden Arches, can't miss it. We order and two seconds later my Hot and Spicy McChicken was ready. It was hot and right off the grill. They customer service is fast and friendly. ... We decided to walk around instead of sitting in the dining area, but it looked as if there was plenty of space to sit down.


Review 13: I do not like McDonald's. However, I am must rate this life- and money-saving institution at the Strip highly because it has served me well, and will continue to do so in all of my future visits. ...  ... The place is clean. The line is short (but then again, I can only vouch for the line between the hours of 0400 and 0700). SERVICE IS SWIFT. And before you sober up, you're out the door with your breakfast in tow. ...  ... What must be commended the most here are the workers. These hardened fellows have seen the best and the very worst of the people of the Strip. These experiences have evolved them to be immune to blatant judgement of the victims and casualties of a good night in Vegas. So shame not my fellow Strip party goers - this is the place to order your 4am breakfast burrito. In Vegas for EDC? Make sure to stop by here to order something to eat to replenish your energy for the next night. I hear a smoothie goes down the easiest after a hard night of raving. The workers here will not judge your zombie gait and your wide-eyed gaze. ...  ... For these reasons, I thank you McDonald's for taking care of me and my peers.


Review 14: I just saw someone else review about 50 chicken nuggets for 9.99, I would've gotten that and split it with a bunch of drunk people if I knew. ...  ... I did come here when it was 109 degrees outside on a June day, I was baking in that hot ass sun.  I came here for some french fries, a few Snack Wraps (grilled and fried Ranch and Honey Mustard, thank you) and for a fucking Mocha Iced Coffee.  I was cheaper here than it was in NY, I was like I could drink this good ass tasting Mocha Iced Coffee every day, but no I didn't. ... Convenient location, I was staying right near here.  It sure did the job when I had a short walk back to Polo Towers on June 16th.  Great times, 24 hours too at this McDonalds, and only saw a few shady looking characters- NOT too many.


Review 15: joseph tang kept bugging me about having to get spicy mcchickens at this mcdonalds......so we finally got around to it at 3am and shared a spicy mcchicken (i guess they dont have these in california...) anyway they're good and cheap. ...  ... we later came back for fries. (after we hit up del taco)  ...  ... yes we like our fast food and yes we are fat.  ...  ... this is a pretty solid establishment i'd say.


Review 16: Minus all the weird drunks, this is a great 24/7 location if you have the munchies...


Review 17: SPICY MCCHICKEN!!!  that is all...


Review 18: This is a great location right on the strip and not as run down as most others. ... Why eat McDonalds when there are millions of super exclusive only in Vegas options? ... Because the food is expensive as hell, because you gambled all your money away, cuz your drunk as shit and a dollar burger will hit the stop right about now? ... Whatever it is, they are there for you 24/7 and they sure hit the spot for me NEEDING an egg McMuffin after a long booze filled Vegas night. ... That and their new chocolate chip frappe. ... I was on my way to Coffee Bean and Tea leaf for an ultimate Mocha when i stopped to get the McMuffin here, my husband got  the chocolate chip frappe and it was so good that we got two more. ... Best damn thing McDonalds ever did and for that i am a fan!


Review 19: This McDonalds is like any other McDonalds...  however, this one gets 4 stars because it is a NEVADA McDonalds... which means it has the SPICY McCHICKEN!  ...  ... Every time I go to vegas, I stop in at a McDonalds just for the spicy mcchicken.... they don't have it on their Cali menus and its oh so much better hot and spicy! Perfect cheap drunk/sober food.


Review 20: This place threw me off... with their single yellow arch that stretched onto the street. Somehow in my second hand smoke induced state, I found the single arch humorous. Ended up satisfying my craving for fries at a normal decent price. Also, this location sells SPICY McChickens! Mmmm... I haven't seen that in California! Also carries Cherry Pies too!


Review 21: This place was such a big shock to us because of their 50 Chicken McNugget for $9.99 deal (which is sad now because the deal is now at ALL Mickey D's... so its not so special anymore). ...  ... Anyways we came back from clubbing at Tao and we got our 100 nuggets, between the 4 of us. I loved seeing the kinds of people at that time... we saw workers who just got off their shifts, professionals, college kids in clubbing clothes like we were, grandparents... we're all different but we got two things in common.. our love for McDonald's and that we're in VEGAS! ...  ... Oh yeah.. the food, you should already know what Mickey D's food is like. ...  ... One star off for having a shady parking lot!


Review 22: Was excited Monte Carlo had a 24 hour McDonalds right by the lobby, and our first meal (*snack) was here. The only reason why I am writing this review is they have a $1 menu, and the mini meals. Also, they don't have the McChicken, but a hot and spicy McChicken, which I hadn't seen, and it is GOOD. and SPICY! I also saw they had the double cheeseburger still for $1, which it isnt in CA, or at least the one I go to. ...  ... Quick and fast!


Review 23: Went here one morning right before going sky diving. Had a good experience. Like all McDonalds, service was good, food was good. Nice and spacious seating area.


Review 24: After a crazy night in Vegas, this is the funniest place to end up at the end of your night. At around 3am, 100% of the patrons here are incredibly drunk and under the influence of something. Everyone in line is just squirming around. My gf and I stood behind a bunch of college kids making out. Hilarious? Yes. Delicious? No... ...  ... On to the food. It really is your average fare. Not much different than any other McDonalds. Like a fugly hook up in the morning, you wake up the next day wondering why you had Mickey D's in the first place. OH! That's right, you were drunk!


Review 25: I am in line for a Sausage McMuffin with Egg.  There are two lines and they are  at least 20 people deep. I am at the end.  This will take at least a half an hour. I talk to a woman in line who is from Georgia.  This is her first time in Vegas.  She tells me the trip was relatively affordable because they are splitting the cost of the room with her boss and friend. I ask her how she likes Vegas so far and she says she loves the artwork and all of the sculptures. I think an elitist might snicker at that, laugh at the fact that someone thinks they are viewing culture in such a material saturated town. She thinks what she sees are cultural artifacts and she is correct. This is America and this is where America comes to let loose, lose money and gawk at the lifestyles of the more fortunate in regards to both wealth and looks.  ...  ... I take my tiny bag and Diet Coke and sit at the counter alone. I eat my sandwich and wish I would have ordered a hash brown. I look out the window and see mainly elderly people have coffee and breakfast. I see some girls sitting at a table and they are all looking at their phones the others go inside to order and one stays behind looking through her LV purse for reasons none other than the fact she is uncomfortable sitting alone even for a few minutes.  ...  ... I throw my bag in the trash, walk out the door and choose the stairs over the escalator and think about the gondolas in The Venetian, the clouds on the ceiling and how the lights and mural make you feel like your outside when in fact you are in a mall similar to the ones you'd find in your own home town minus the opera singing actors and hyper-sexualized ads at every turn.


Review 26: I know, I know.  It's a fast food joint...what is there really to say?  It's not like the food here is going to taste all that different than a McDonald's just about anywhere else.  So, with all of the great restaurants and buffets in Vegas to eat at and Yelp about, why the hell am I reviewing a McDonald's you ask?  Well, I'll tell you why: ...  ... 50 nuggets for $9.99.  (edit:  how awesome would it be if FIDDY CENT was FIDDY NUGGET?  Okay, anyways...haha). ...  ... I know...crazy, right?  Now, you're probably thinking that's either (A) an amazing yet awesome deal, or (B) an amazing yet kinda disgusting one.  If you aren't really sure how you feel, figure it this way: if you're in line with your friends, riding a good buzz and feeling hungry in the middle of the night, you're probably thinking (A).  If you're pretty sober, waiting for your drunk friends to buy food and bring it to the table, you might find yourself leaning towards (B).  Now, if you're sitting there at the table, wondering how the hell you and your 11 friends ended up getting two orders, yet still find yourself having some because really, who is going to notice a few of the 100 or so missing, then...well, welcome to my world! ...  ... Kudos to them for staying open 24 hours and being there for my friends when we found out Pink's was closed.  And remember, sometimes it really is true that "what happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas".  Just ask all those nuggets we left behind that we couldn't/refused to finish.


Review 27: I've had a number of Spicy Chicken sandwiches before but I must admit that at this McDonalds, these sandwiches are spicy!!  ...  ... Fresh french fries? Not here... they were as cold as cold can be. Very disappointing. ...  ... Overall, it was a decent place to grab a cheap ice cream cone and a sandwich to try and not spoil being hungry for dinner time at Benihana!


Review 28: Not fair that the meal prices are bumped up because its located on the strip. (But i actually never went inside so Im getting this feedback from my cheap brother!) ... Thumbs up that its located on the strip though! ... Little scary as I sat in the parking lot and watched bums and the night crew doing the trash run. Looked dirty from the outside..but i was outside!  ...  ... Hey it was late..I ate the food. They served the purpose I needed.


Review 29: Pros: Spicy McChicken $1. Really good. A specialty late night snack on the strip. Fast service. ...  ... Cons: Very dirty. Tons of bums. Line can go down the stairs on some nights. They run out of certain foods. Machines break down. ...  ... What else do you expect in the middle of the strip?


Review 30: So a few cocktails may have inspired some "it's-midnight-and-I-NEEEEEED-some-McD's" munchies.   ...  ... However, this McD's was right next door to our hotel and it really hit the spot.  It's easy to stumble to....I mean, find...  And it was hot and fresh. ...  ... What I did not appreciate was the fact that when I checked the bag ( I am SO glad I always check the bag, and here's why), they were missing a medium fries AND a big mac.  Not cool. ...  ... Then when I brought it to their attention, there was no apology, no eye contact, there were actually no words whatsoever.  They just put the missing items in the bag and walked away.  Umm.  Thanks?


Review 31: A typical Las Vegas Strip dive. Full of drunks looking for greasy food at night. Filthy dirty inside. Soda machines are all out of carbonation. My wife had to wipe the seats and table herself before we sat. She even put down a layer of napkins before sitting. To top it all off something is dripping out of the ceiling. I gave it two stars because it's exactly as I imagined it from the outside view and it's cheap.  Plus the grease is a great remedy for a twisted tummy after a long hard night of drinking.


Review 32: It was okay customer service, and in a way I can;t believe I went here....Mc Donald's always somewhere where you can expect the usual prices, but the crowd was uncomforting to be around....felt like I was in a mix of a social security office in the poverty back when my family was struggling between advertising/dealing on the streets with flyers..but maybe I;m just being unkind, which I guess I am. At least the drinks were okay.....The thing hated most, the cheese! What the heck kind of cheese was this man? Government artificial cheese? Highly dissatisfied, made the whole burger unexceptional and sad on McDonald's management and Vegas part.


Review 33: Horrible, horrible service. The cashier who rung in me and my parents was Amanda, and she honestly acted like she was doing me and my family the biggest favor by taking our order. I'm asked her to make my egg mcmuffin without the egg yolk (which is something i have done whenever I order an egg mcmuffin) and she first asked me what an egg yolk was (i explained the yellow thing in the center) and then she said there was no way she could do that. That's a blatant lie. Everytime I order this I don't eat the egg yolk. I was extremely frustrated, and then she told me she asked her manager who also said that could be done. Needless to say we left, and we're never coming back.


Review 34: HUUUUUUUMPH. ...  ... Boyfriend and I..... drunk....walked past by this branch and all of a sudden wanted a double quarter pounder with cheese and a 20pc nuggets. ... I also for some reason wanted a double cheeseburger with extra onions. ...  ... We had the bag and been munching on the fries on our long walk to Mandalay...only to find out...they didn't put my double cheeseburger in the bag..but charged me for it. HUUUUMPH! ...  ... Dont' do that to me when I'm drunk.


Review 35: I used to despise McDonald's. The service was slow, the employees were rude, and worst of all, the food was greasy and incredibly unhealthy. Over time, McDonald's built up their image, introduced some healthy menu items, and slowly regained my interest. ...  ... Walking down the strip, I was craving some affordable food. (Whoever said Vegas had cheap food must have lost their mind.) The arch bursting forth onto the sidewalk not only grabbed my interest, but made me incredibly excited to get a salad. ...  ... When I walked in, the place was a lot of smaller than I would have expected, but there was only one person in front of me, so I figured it wouldn't matter since there wasn't a crowd.  ...  ... I placed my order and stood off to the side. The salads are usually made at the beginning of the day, and it takes less than a minute to grab the salad, the dressing, and plastic-ware. However it took over 20 minutes to get the damn thing. Not only that, but they tried giving me the wrong salad several times, then told me they were out of the dressing I requested, then blamed it on someone in the back kitchen.  ...  ... Really though, I'd rather overpay at one of the nicer casinos. Skip this place.


Review 36: I'm a fan of McDonald's... this particular one, however, not so much.  We waited in a long line around 9pm just to deal with not-so-friendly service.  I have to get honey with my chicken nuggets and according to the staff, they don't have it.  They were also "sold out" of milkshakes.  Have you ever heard of a McD's selling out of milkshakes?  Think not.  The soda/condiment area was dirty, so much that I almost skipped the ketchup.  We sat outside on the patio, even though it was a bit chilly, to avoid the odd stench inside.  This is the worst McD's I've ever been in.. and that's a big feat.


Review 37: just cause it's right here on the main strip, doesn't mean that the service is better. try getting your food in 10 minutes from the time of your order.


Review 38: Worst experience ever !!! They took over 20 ns to get me my food and that was the drive thru !!! Never coming again !!


Review 39: Worst McDonald's ever. Full of drunk people off the strip. Bums hang around inside and outside the restaurant. Hookers and pimps hang out there. The employees are loud and ghetto and very unprofessional. Go to the nicer McDonald's by Planet Hollywood instead.


Review 40: Yes, we stopped here to grab a late-night burger.  The group didn't feel like shelling out tons of dough for a proper restaurant meal when we just wanted a snack.  It just wasn't the cleanest and most pleasant of places to sit and eat.  You have been forewarned:  all sorts of odd-looking customers run in and out of this McDonald's.

Review 0: It's your typical McDonald's, the difference here is that it's open 24 hours! ...  ... A ton of seating. Fast service even in the early morning hours. ...  ... Perfect if you're staying at the MGM Grand.


Review 1: This is your typical McDonald's fare in a food court setting. It was definitely the least expensive meal of the weekend and I was happy to see that they have normal McDonalds prices, including the dollar menu (a lot of touristy places do not).  The line moved quickly and my order was correct. No complaints here!


Review 2: Biggest collective lines of anything at MGM Grand as far as I can tell. The food is fine here. My only issue that is, apparently, they decided to pull some customer unfriendly design stuff by having people wait for their food at the counter at the same register that they ordered from, so it looks like it's moving really slowly at times. Still, it's cheaper than everywhere else, so it's "A-OK" as Yelp calls 3 stars.


Review 3: This is exactly where you want to eat after you blow all your money in Vegas.


Review 4: This McDonalds is no different then any other McDonald's even if it I the rock in roll one. Great place to come if you want to see schwasted people of all ... Shapes and sizes:)


Review 5: Went to this in late January when returning from a late night walking out on the strip (probably between 12 and 1 in the morning), trying to find something to eat in the giant MGM.  Seemed like we had to walk forever to find this place, which we weren't actually looking for, but rather were just trying to find something to eat, period.  The other places at this food court were closed and the only other signs of life were the blasting music coming from the clubs before and after it. ...  ... A typical McDonalds which I guess is opened late, if not all the time?  They did have something I never saw before, which was being able to order 40 nuggets (I think?) at a time, which is no doubt popular for the cheap party crowd?    ...  ... Anyways we had quarter pounders and fries which weren't anything special and really nothing more than a way of taking care of a late night hunger.  Service was ordinary, and the tables in the food court were in decent repair with a sleeping bum (I'm assuming by his clothing and appearance) and some young college aged kids as patrons.


Review 6: Surprisingly, you'll end up going to McDonald's more often than not in Vegas for the following reasons (1) it's a cheap option; (2) it's a convenient option; (3) it's probably one of the few options late at night.  Lines tend to be long here at the MGM Food Court and it's not a very luxurious experience.  Come here only by necessity.  [Original Visit: November 6, 2010]


Review 7: The ABSOLUTE worst McDonald's on the planet! PERIOD! The only reason why I didn't give them a 1 star is because Mcdonald's food is great! ...  ... The service at this particular restaurant is by far the suckiest form of service known to man. My 4 year old niece delivers food to me in a more respectable way. After waiting in line for 45 mins to order, you have to wait another 45 mins to get your food. The only thing I can imagine playing in my head while watching how the workers go about their duties could be circus theme music.  ...  ... We were talking to people around us while we stood in amazement on how bad the service was. One lady waited 30 mins for coffee, not leaving just to see how long it would actually take for her coffee to come. After the second time she asked for her coffee, the manager herself had the audacity to give her attitude.  ...  ... As a continuing supportive customer to the Mcdonald's brand, I strongly suggest that you send people there to teach them how to run their lines. The people their obviously do not know what they are doing!


Review 8: So your probably wondering, why would anyone bother to yelp a McDonald's.  I'll tell you why! I love Mickey D chicken nuggets, and as often as I eat them, I have never been to a McDonald's before that told me they are out of Sweet & Sour sauce!!!  Seriously it's like WTF! How do you run out of Sweet & Sour sauce!!!  With the amount of preservatives in it, I don't think the stuff ever expires, so you should have a crate of it in back just in case!


Review 9: This review is strictly for the wacker than wack McDonalds a.k.a McDONT ...  ... So me and my best girl partied hard one nite n Vegas and as u know all things must cum 2 an end. So after the club we go back to our hotel room which is at the MGM. We stop at the front desk to ask if anything was still open at 4 in da monin. They said yes if u walk to our farmers market (which is kinda far and even farther if u been on your feet all day & all nite in some hills) we have a pizza spot & a McDonalds that's 24hours. I so hat3 McD's so we said we would walk back there for the pizza.  ...  ... So needless to say we get there and both lines are long but McDONT'S is shorter. We both are tired azz h3ll & just want something in our system so we can soak up the liquor & go to bed. So we stand in line for I don't know how long for that nasty azz food get up to the freakin counter to hear we outta food all we have is 5 fishes and 2 chicken. EXCUSE ME !!  ...  ... 1st off ... what the h3ll language r u speakin ? I guess 5 fishes is supposed to be fillet of fish & the 2 chicken with no "s" is supposed to be some kind of chicken sandwich. So 2nd'ly...I get upset bcuz y u did not announce that to everyone standing in line. Were practically standing there 4 no freakin reason. So my girl orders the darn 2 chicken. 3rd...who in the h3ll is managing this place ? How r u gonna b open 24hrs and DON'T have any food ? Just freakin turn the lights off at 10pm y don't u !!! ...  ... So now were on the long walk back to the room. We get there kick our shoes off get comfy open up our 2 chicken and WOW... bread...mayo...chicken. WHERE THE H3LL IS MY LETTUCE ? WHERE IS MY TOMATOES ? So now I am forced to eat this dry azz sandwich no fries to go with it ( thats the only thing i eat at McDont's is there addictive french fries) and some left over water from the club cuz oh yes...these fools didnt have any beverages either. ...  ... Can some 1 help me understand how a fast food chain that claim they sold over a billion hamburgers and so forth run out of food...IN VEGAS...@ THE MGM GRAND who has bookoo money. ...  ... So the next nite U know we had to do it all over again but this time we went straight to the pizza spot. I told the pizza man what happened the night b4 and he said  "IT'S ALWAYS LIKE THAT, THEY SHUT DOWN IF THEY RUN OUT OF KETCHUP PACKAGES" ...  ... In an event of a late night... DO NOT GO 2 MCDONT'S !!!!! U will b HIGHLY upset ! ...  ... 0.0 stars...They deserve 100 rocks thrown @ em


Review 10: You got lucky being right near the start line at 6:15am when it was 30 degrees out, the line at Starbucks was a mile long, and my friend and I have this tradition of getting your egg mcmuffins at each race since the San Diego Rock 'n' Roll marathon.   ...  ... We woke up extra early, braved the elements, and you were wonderfully warm.  We decided we would stay inside that blanket of heat until the start of the race.  It turns out everyone else had the same idea but the lines moved fast.  Wow!  How is that possible?  Oh, you anticipated this so you have egg mcmuffins all ready to go as well as coffee and juice.  You made them the night before?  How good can they possibly be?   ...  ... I order mine without sausage and your employee freaks out.  He tells me they're already made and if I could just take the sausage out.  I give him a look and say I want it made fresh.  He consults with another employee and ultimately the manager and they agree that I should get a fresh egg mcmuffin.  Gee, thanks.  Also, what's with the $7 price tag?  Did you raise the prices the night before the marathon?  I've never paid that much for a combo meal.  You're supposed to be the cheap breakfast option. ...  ... I get my supposed fresh egg mcmuffin and notice it's not so fresh.  The cheese is burnt as well as the muffin and there's sausage residue on my muffin.  How did that happen?  My juice is warm because you left it out in anticipation of a rush.   ...  ... Next marathon, I won't be coming back.  I'll buy muffins somewhere the night before and just make do.

Review 0: I've been rather disappointed in the McD's I've been stopping in lately, and I remember this being a total dive years ago. Came in for sodas-the staff is nice, the place is clean; then my cousin and I were very impressed at how well the team was communicating with each other.


Review 1: Very friendly service. Very nice Manager. ^_^


Review 2: Very nice store and clean.  Fast service & the manager Maria very friendly.


Review 3: I really enjoy this location of the McDonalds. There are a few problems I have with it though. I have asked for water (this was twice within a fifteen minute period) and never received it. When I ordered three chocolate sundaes, they had no problem getting them to me! Just don't ask for something like water. There are also a lot of bums that hang out in there and it can become unsafe for kids. For the most part, John (the main manager) will drive them out of there after awhile. There are also a lot of teenagers which can become somewhat unruly. It is not in the greatest area, but it is actually a good location. The quality of the food seems great though...


Review 4: The kid won't eat at Del Taco, so it's a two-stop lunch.  Fine.   ...  ... Ordered easily in the drive-thru, tended prompted to my a young woman with dual eyebrows (unusual, but not bad: the original set, and a second pair penciled about an inch higher; interesting look), and out the door again. ...  ... The girl toy in the kid's meal was a decorate-yourself little generic Hot Wheels car, but she's a tomboy and loves stickers, so no harm, no foul.


Review 5: Yesterday I was starving so I stopped by here for a Southwest salad. To my surprise, this salad was full of fresh romaine lettuce and warm moist strips of pretty tasty chicken. This salad has only 450 calories which is a huge plus. They have two other types of salad for even less calories, but I bet they aren't as tasty as this one. I highly recommend going to McDonald for a last minute salad instead of the Taco Bell's Cantina bowl.


Review 6: it's in not the best  condition, staff is small which creates long lines and also the food is not  so good, I had the impression that they change the  oil very rare . But  the ice cream is the same, is good!


Review 7: New modern design set up more lap top friendly with counter and AC outlets. Crew still is not a friendly as other locations. Other than that it is a McDonalds serving McDonalds


Review 8: We stopped by last night to check out the McRib so this review is for that. I can honestly say that the McRib is McGross. The sauce cloyingly sweet, the meat had the texture of a sponge and after a couple bites I threw it out. Im not quite sure that the big deal is about with this sandwich. I do remember having one as a kid but like Twinkies somethings just taste better when you're young.  ...  ... The staff here was really friendly and while the sandwich was gross, it was served hot and fresh.


Review 9: Good morning, this morning before 730am myself and my fiance went to this mcdonalds drive-thru placed an order and left. We went to go wash when my fiance discovered a counterfiet $50 bill when he went back in his wallet with the receipt that was handed to us from the cashier that was working at this time. We made a first trip back to let the working manager there Chris told us"no this is real" we explained to him the money was to thick and it just didn't seem right. When he told us"oh no its real you see the face, its real" we went back to the laundrymat finished up our loads to wash made one more errund to a dollar general and then made a last stop at our local friendly speedeemart. I went into the store and try to purchase a few items. When I gave this same bill that we recived from this mcdonalds to the clerk as soon as she touched it she said to me"sweety this is not real" she advice me to put it in a slot machine if it spits it out its not real, I did this twice, only because I don't gamble and I was furious we made a third trip back spoke to another manager buy the name of John. He tried to tell us he can't verify what happened. Once we told him we were calling the police both the drivethru cashier and the manager chris who told us this bill was real left immediately together. I rarely I mean rarely eat out but I will not go to this location or any other location for this exact reason. My fiance is a porter and i am a Dental Assistant we are hard working honest people. I will be filing a report first thing Tuesday morning since it is a holiday tomorrow. Watch your currency please oh by the way the store number is#975 address 3815 south maryland prkway las vegas nevada 89109. Thank you and be aware of your ... transactions ...  Kelvin and Phaedra!

Review 0: Looking at these other reviews maybe I came on a good day, employees were fast and efficient with a smile.  Place is nice and clean for a busy Mcdonald's. A good stop before heading home.


Review 1: The new McDonald's carries on with the modern designs of their current restaurants in and out of Las Vegas. The drink refill stations are easily accessible. ...  ... Nice seating throughout including booths, round tables, leather chairs around circular tables, and pub style high stools. There are several LCD screen TV's inside to catch a sporting event or news. ...  ... Glass is used to separate areas of the restaurant while simultaneously allowing for a open feel. The overly sized and low hanging chandelier creates a center focus to this slightly smaller square footage restaurant. There is no play place for kids. ...  ... The LCD ordering screens are cool and add to the futuristic theme. I will be back because Blue Diamond Road is highly accessible from the I-15 freeway in both directions.


Review 2: Want fast food McDonald's is always a classic been going to McDonald's since I was little kid.oh memories lol  If you are on a budget and not on a diet McDonald's is you place to be.lol ...  ... Happy eating xoxoxo


Review 3: Food is what you expect from mcds. But the service is horrible. I had bought lots food. They handed me a handful of ketchup. But when I asked for another sauce, like ranch or sweet n sour. They only gave me one packet. Then they said they charge 25 cents for any extra packets. Mcds has become greedy. After spending like 15 dollars on food. They wanna charge for sauce. Screw them. Ill go to jacks where they give you any amount of sauce you want for free.


Review 4: @McDonalds #34841 change over #disaster arrive at 10:32 to order breakfast #NO, lunch order placed at 10:38 got order at 10:54. HORRIBLE!!! ...  ... Try to get breakfast at 10:31am on a Sunday. Good luck.  ...  ... They will not give you your drink cup while you are waiting. They tell you it will come out with the order.  ...  ... Service staff ignore customers at the counter. One disgruntled family was so frustrated on their order not getting delivered that they wanted a refund. The cashier ignored them which infuriated them more. When the cashier finally acknowledged them it got worse. They had two receipts (around $27 worth of food) and the cashier kept trying to total them both to give them their money back and she could not get the right number which upset the guest more. Advice to the cashier: Refund one receipt at a time. (No Math Involved) ...  ... This is a beautiful McDonalds but the staff is NOT FRIENDLY, POLITE or COURTEOUS. How about the friendly greeting that other McDonalds do and a wave or Thank You when you leave. Recommend that you dismantle this team and start from scratch because they obviously were never taught or forgot the core values of McDonalds corporation.


Review 5: Came here before i left for home.  I ordered the Big Mac combo meal. I feel like crap now.  My stomach has sharp pains.  Threw up 3 times and cant get off the toilet...now i need to drive 7 hours back to the california coast.  I dont recommend this place if your traveling.


Review 6: Day and time of incident: Sunday, April 6, 2014 - 10:40am. ...  ... I'll make it brief.. ordered food, 20 minutes later, still no food. Hungry, want to get on the road asap. Decided instead of arguing for food to get refund and head across the street to In N Out. (Should of been first choice, shot my own foot!) *sigh* ...  ... Not exactly sure who is at fault here, whether management or employee. ...  ...   Apparently this female employee did not have the competence to add up my order and refund my money.. maybe if she was a teenager, that would of been excusable. ...   As she was pushing buttons on the monitor and looking back and forth at my receipt, she started twitching and looked liked the monitor was a ticking time bomb from how fast she was going trying to disable it from blowing her into smithereens. After a few unfortunate attempts and still unable to add up the order to the equivalent price for refund, she jumped, panicked, starting speaking gibberish and then turned around and left to the back of the kitchen. ...  ... Extremely disrespectful leaving us there and would say unprofessional of her but then again, not sure if her (just assuming) G.E.D or high school diploma even covered that term. Which then points to management and the kind of training they provide to their employees. ... Poor lady, sure do feel sorry for her. Supervisor gave me my refund, ate a delicious burger from In N Out, drove back to California. ...  ... Customer Service = ZERO stars. ...  ... Words of Wisdom:Stay In School Kids and Get Good Grades.


Review 7: I travel a ton. This has to be the worst service I have ever experienced!  Pitiful. How tough is it?


Review 8: I've ate here dining in about a month ago around 3 in the afternoon. The service was far from great. The manager took our order with no smile, and had the look of I could care less on her face.  ...  ... Atleast who ever was in the kitchen served us fresh food, and THANK YOU! I'm used to having to complain about the food. But hopefully this manager was just having VERY off day. I might give it another try, but I do not think it will be the near future. ...  ... The one inside Arroyo Crossing shopping center treats me better!


Review 9: No straw + 30 min drive thru time = RIDICULOUS!!!! Wake up you are on the morning shift. Drink some coffee. Listen to your customers. I told them what I ordered at the second window before they gave me my food and they still tried to give me the wrong food. Don't even ask me if you insist on giving me food that isn't mine. Thanks for the no straw too. Appreciate that.


Review 10: The fries were cold and tasted like they were sitting out forever... Isnt McDonalds supposed to be known for their fries?? I posted a pic...


Review 11: They ignored our attempts to order and would not acknowledge us at the window when we tried to see if anyone was even there. So rude and the food is cold.

Review 0: Great for a hangover, totally awesome and fresh tasting (I mean for fast food that is!), I just can't in good conscience give a fast food restaurant a 5 star rating haha


Review 1: I stayed in the Luxor and it was very convenient to stop by this McDonald's and grab something. Sometimes the lines looked long but they went by quickly...I never waited longer than 3 or 4 minutes. They never asked to see my receipt for a refill...so maybe that rule that is mentioned in other reviews has changed. My only quarrel is that there isn't a refill machine as there are in other food courts.


Review 2: This McDonalds was a freaking life saver when my girlfriend and I arrived and checked-in to Luxor at 1 AM! ...  ... Service at night was suuuper slow... not sure if its all the drunk people ordering that made it slow or they were understaffed, but that 10 minute wait seemed like 30.  ...  ... Came back 8 hours later for breakfast and I swear everything changed and my order was literally done within 20 seconds of me actually placing my order! Un-freaking-believable.  ...  ... Anyway, for the price... you get what you pay for. Inside your Luxor coupon booklet, you will find savings you can use for a few items... so use them wisely.


Review 3: If I was writing this review a couple of weeks previous, I'd be saying that eating in this Mcdonalds is kind of like eating in a Disneyfied Egypt. In Vegas, things change fast within a couple of weeks. As I write this, the Luxor food court and it's McDonalds are being remodeled. Gone is the Disneyfied Egypt environment, and the unique environment of this Mcdonalds and food court. When I looked at the diagram of the remodel (there is a picture I took of it for the review), it shows a design looks more like the Aria than Egypt. Hopefully this not going to be a further de-theming of the Luxor. It is still a special Mcdonalds, being that it is the one and only McDonalds in a pyramid. As far as seating, the beginning stages of the remodel seem to have added more. ...    Focusing on the McDonalds, it is usually busy. But the lines move fast. A couple of months previous, I would write that the prices are inflated. Nowadays it seems that the majority of McDonalds have raised their prices. However this location does not offer the $1 deal on all size cold beverages. ...   An interesting fact is that both this and the Excalibur McDonalds serve Pepsi beverages in lieu of Coke beverages. ...   There is a high chance of me returning here. It is convenient when I hang out on the South Strip. I am also curious what it will look like after the remodel.


Review 4: Only one refill is offered and the receipt is needed. Usually, there is a line for ordering but getting the order is somewhat quick. Typically, if it is a busy, the ordering process takes a while. Plenty of seating around inside of the Luxor food court area. No WiFi offered from this location.


Review 5: After 2am the wait was horrible! Roughly about 20 minutes waiting to order, then another 10 minutes waiting for food that you would expect to be hot and fresh with the wait...nope! Light heated floppy fries, and almost stale chicken nuggets. Even the McDouble was warm (not fresh and hot).


Review 6: Although I am not a huge fan of chain fast food places, I do have to admit that I am addicted to McDonald's fries.  This place is your typical cheap fast food / food court eatery inside of a casino, so don't expect much.  Actually, it's a little worse than usual ...  ... Food:  Typical menu for McDonalds with your burger and fries combo meals.  I typically get a #2 (two cheese burgers) with a large order of fries and a Coke.  Burgers were what to be expected; really skinny, sloppily put together, a little bit on the salty side and lukewarm. Fries were about the same, not very fresh and lukewarm in temperature.  The worst part of the meal was the drink.  McDonalds from around the world have always carried Coke products, so I was hugely disappointed when the cashier told me "we don't have Coke, is Pepsi ok?"  I was in shock, and almost offended by this.  I'm not one of those "love Coke, hate Pepsi" crazy type of people.  I actually never drink soda, but when I splurge for fast food and get McDonalds I always get a Coke to drink.  Pepsi just does not taste the same with my fries.  I got a Dr. Pepper instead to drink and it just tasted wrong.  ...  ... Price:  Although the prices are a dollar or 2 higher than non-casino locations, McDonalds is still a cheap option for a quick bite to eat.  Their dollar menu is more like a "$2" menu, and their combo meals are still a good price considering that the food will fill you up. ...  ... Atmosphere:  This McDonalds is on the second story food court of the Excalibur casino.  There are a lot of other fast food choices there, and a lot of available seating all over the place.  You go up to the order counter, place you order, pay, and wait for your number to be called.  Drinks are self-service.  The seating area within the designated McDonalds area was a bit direct and crowded, but if you don't mind walking your tray around you can find much cleaning seating in the middle of the food court area. ...  ... Staff / Service:  Typical fast food cashiers.  Not much of a smile from them.  They punch in your order and hand you area receipt.  The food staff were running around and yelling at each other in the back, but again this is typical for McDonalds. ...   ... Overall, this place isn't really good, but it's not extraordinarily bad either.  Food could be warmer, staff could be friendlier, but it is a fast food chain so you can't expect too much.  They only have Pepsi drinks, so if you go in prepared for that you should be ok.


Review 7: dont call my order number if you still haven't bagged my food yet, make eye contact with me, then let me stand there literally for a few minutes while you continue to prep and call out other orders.  ...  ... all i wanted was a 20 pc w/o the 15 minute wait and the attitude after i asked for sauce.


Review 8: McDonalds inside the Luxor food court. All the food was over priced vs typical McDonalds. The fries were soggy and limp instead of their usual golden cripsyness.


Review 9: Horrible service- people that work here look like they hate their Job and their customers. Pick-up system is very disorganized.  ... The first time I went they forgot my drink. My boyfriend asked for it and the manager  looked offended and took a while to give us my drink. Didn't even apologize.  The second time they forgot my yogurt parfait. I didn't realize it until we got back to our hotel room.  ... Awful, awful, awful.


Review 10: I don't usually review fast food 'restaurants' but I had to say something about this McDonald's. We came here twice, based upon convenience alone, and it was a train wreck.  ...  ... First of all, what is up with the ordering/pickup organization? When I have to squeeze into the same window as customers ordering, when I'm attempting to pick up a burger, this is a problem. Also, it seemed like the person 'shouting' out order numbers couldn't muster up the enthusiasm to actually call the numbers loud enough for customers to hear, which caused some confusion. ...  ... And to top things off, I was put down for asking for napkins. Apparently, I was s'posed to know that napkins are in the fartherst corner of the food court. Shame on me for not knowing. I deserved the condescending attitude and to be treated like a moron.  ...  ... Never again.


Review 11: Omg wow send a random investor through the line wow


Review 12: The food was McDonalds, nuff said... My issue was with my cashier. She spoke little English and then she didn't give me the 6.00 portion of my 6.68.  She gave me the change, but no cash.  I looked at her and asked for the rest of my change and she said she gave it to me?!? Uh, no ya didn't...  I told her to look at my purse there is no cash in there... She acted like I was in the wrong.. She calls her manager who comes over and she takes her drawer and counts it in the back office.  Okay, so my food is sitting on the counter getting cold.  After about 10 mins the manger comes over and hands me $6.00 no I am sorry, thank you...nothing! The manger said to the cashier, it was $6 over... Thanks for the cold fries and aggravation!


Review 13: This McDonalds is located inside of the Luxor food court. We visited at around 2:45am after a night on the town. Seemed convenient enough. We were so wrong. It took an hour for us to get our food! We didn't eat until 3:45!  ...  ... The ordering line moves relatively fast. Then you wait for the short handed staff to take their sweet time making your food incorrectly (like my bacon quarter pounder with no freaking bacon!), only to have it ready after the five people behind you already got their food. Then you get to pick it up with the soda that they filled up for you at the time of your order. Warm, flat, iced down soda just goes so well with every meal, doesn't it? ...  ... Everyone waiting looked super frustrated. They really need to beef up their night team... no joke. I know most of the clientele at that time of night are stumbling drunks, but we are still paying customers and probably the MOST eager to get our food and run back to our hotels. Better service is deserved!  ...  ... Unfortunately the guy who passed out at the table while waiting for his food probably never even got his meal. He will only leave with memories of waking up in a random food court. Tears. ...  ... Ronald, for real, get it together over here!


Review 14: Wouldn't give me a cup of water with my meal, bad customer service. Not enjoyable experience here at all.

Review 0: The best service  ...  ... &  ...  ... quality food  ...  ...  ... in McDonald's Corporation!


Review 1: Fast service & food. They have quick daytime drive through staff. Have been coming here for about a year and a half. Sometimes the WiFi works, which is always nice, if you're inside. The free drink refills are good, as some places inside of casinos, charge the entire price for a refill. It is conveniently located across the street from Mandalay Bay and is frequented by people who work on the strip, so you know it's easy to deal with.


Review 2: The cashier wearing the name tag Michaelangelo was an outstanding employee. I went in with the intention of buying a BigMac meal large size and the smallest size order of chicken nuggets. He SOLD me and said that the smallest mcnugget (4 piece) was approx 2.99 and that for a few more bucks I could get a 20 piece. Point taken and I got both the meal and 20 mcnuggets. The drink area was in a disarray but he went out of his way to make sure everything was back up to standards. (I was observing this while I was eating my food order). Overall great experience


Review 3: Funny, Las Vegas has a few ChicDonald's haha! They have nice furnishings inside - unlike most McDonald's in Los Angeles. Does the food taste better? No, but I have heard that they tried to sell pizza at Vegas McDonald's.... Unsuccessfully of course, but still - very interesting! ...  ... We were here very, very early in the morning and there was no one manning the registers but the manager was walking by checking them. She looked around when she saw us to see if she could get someone to at least greet us but there was no one so she had to do it herself haha! When one of her drones heard her greeting we finally got our order taken. ...  ... The food was as "good" as at any McD's and they did not mess up our order. ...  ... It was very early in the morning granted, but still, many tables were dirty - no excuses!  ...  ... It may be a ChicDonald's but it merits only three stars anyway.


Review 4: Last stop as I was leaving Las Vegas.  McDonalds is pretty much the same everywhere.


Review 5: Convenient. Hit this place up on our way outta town for the standard hang over breakfast faire. ...  ... The lady at the drive through window gave us the stink eye and then yelled at us after she took off her headset for dumping about an ounce of water out of a cup we had in the cup holder from a few days before. ...  ... Really lady? Got your panties all in a super twist over an ounce of water that evaporated off the hot black top. Get over it.


Review 6: I work in the area so have eaten at this location numerous times. ...  ... The location is right across from the Mandalay Bay. ...  ... The staff at this location changes constantly. But no matter how often the staff changes you can always count on them being inept.  ...  ... If you have to eat here I'd suggest walking inside. The drive through is always a long wait. ...  ... The food is typical McDonalds except for their french fries. At most McDonalds I love their fries...not at this place. They're always old and it taste as if they never change the oil in their fryer.  I've never had a good french fry at this place. ...  ... If you're really craving McDonalds I'd suggest you try another one.


Review 7: Pretty typical of a McDonald's but the sign outside drew me in like a moth to a flame.


Review 8: I can"t believe this is the first time in my life  I came to this  McDonalds. The coffee refill is limited to only one refill. I am very disappointed.  For what I paid for the coffee. I should go to Starbucks.


Review 9: I get that there can be miscommunication over the drive thru window but come on now.. We're ASKING a question, stop assuming we're ordering, especially when we preface our question with "I have a question."  We asked if they had the meal that comes with 2 mcmuffins. She put in an order for 2 sandwiches only.  We say no that's not what we want to order we want to know if you have the meal. She takes it off and adds milk instead. Frustrated, we just ordered two number 2s with orange juice. ... No apologies for the miscommunication she just gives a total and stops talking.  We had to wait til we got to her to find out of she got the order correct (no milk or any other random items).  All was fine but her attitude was not. we could not wait to move on to the next window.  But alas, the car in front was waiting for their order for forever!   ...  ... We finally make it to the food window and I tell my bf to ask for ketchup.  Window opens  and lady serving us our bags was nice and at least days good morning.  But then she hands us our bag and our drinks and says no straws (for our orange juices) and closes the window.  We could barely say "ketchup please!"  Thank god she heard as the window was closing.   ...  ... WTF store #22506.  McDonald's, this is UNSATISFACTORY.  No straws (and heard the cashier tell another customer that there were no frappes), bad attitude and horrible service! From all the reviews I've read for this location your management needs to step it up.  I know I will take my business elsewhere than this establishment.. Next time I'll just hit up Winchells next door.


Review 10: Terrible service, inept workers and poor management. Bathroom was filthy as well.  ... Manager did nothing after a worker screamed at my friend for no reason- completely uncalled for.  3 words: Don't come here.


Review 11: This is seriously the worst drive thru in las vegas. I live nearby and go here often, out of convenience. They forget everything and mess up even the simplest tasks. The other day, they gave me a burger without a burger in it. It was just a bun with onions and cheese. I brought it back and the guy doesn't even apologize, just throws me another one and laughs. I get that it's kind of a funny mistake, but these stoner kids working there don't give a shit that you had to drive all the way back to get a new one.  ...  ... The lady who takes orders on most days is a total b*tch, too. Everything she says just comes off as super aggressive and rude.

Review 0: I've been coming to this McDonalds for awhile now, though I don't go at 130 due to the obnoxious high school kids. But now there is a new owner and it seems as if he doesn't tolerate the loitering which I am so thankful for. I can actually bring in my toddler and not worry about what she's going to hear or see! This location is also extremely clean


Review 1: Not sure why this McDonald's is showing as closed. It is connected to the Terrible's gas station and still in business. They have a 24 hour drive-thru as well. ...  ... I have never been inside, only ordered at the drive-thru. The employees are pretty friendly, they have fast service, and no problems with my orders so far.  I love the $1 large sweet teas!! ...  ... I moved to the area a few weeks ago and have driven by here before, but could not remember if I saw a sign saying that they had a 24 hour drive-thru. So the first time I came here, I asked the cashier at the first window: ...  ... Me: Is your drive-thru 24 hours? ... Employee: Ummm...... I think so? But I'm not sure. Do you want me to ask?  ... Me: That's okay, I'll ask at the next window. ...  ... LOL he works there and didn't know what their drive-thru hours were?!?! Come on!! Well, as I drove up to the second window to get my food, I saw the 24 hour sign.  ...  ... But still, as an employee, you should at least know what the restaurant's hours are right??


Review 2: I stopped here to use the Redbox machine.  I then went inside and got a McDonald's McCaf frapp, chocolate chip variety. ...  ... Service was prompt with a nice smile from the young lady at the counter.  She made the drink quickly and it was very good.  I've been here a few times in the past and it's a convenient stop on Flamingo.


Review 3: My mom needed to meet a client to pick up documents and I was her chauffeur for the day. The lobby is really nice, as is all their locations in the Southwest that I've been to, due to recent renovations. Very modern, classy, and extremely clean. This location featured an opaque black and white rendition of the Las Vegas Strip on the glass separating the restaurant from Terrible's convenience store. The new digital menus are really nice as well and easy to read.  ...  ... I don't really eat at McDonald's, so I can't say much about the food. What I do usually order and enjoy was their Vanilla Cone. Delicious non-fat vanilla soft serve in a light and crispy cone. The best part of this location is the fact that it is one of the very few corporate stores in the valley and offers the Vanilla Cone at just $0.49 ($0.53 after sales tax)!! What an awesome deal! Especially when franchised locations charge $1 and up. ...  ... So, based on the nice, welcoming lobby and consistently delicious Cone, I have no complaints.  ...  ... BONUS: Free Wi-Fi and the lobby and drive-thru are open 24 hours!


Review 4: 9 times out of 10 the service or food or both are horrible.  After getting my entire order wrong I waited while they made the correct meals.  At home 1 block away my meals were cold, hamburger looked and tasted like yesterdays.  The fries limp and loaded with oil.  If you can not get fresh fries at lunch time, when can you get it.  We will skip this McDonald it never improves


Review 5: Came here this morning around 2:30-3am with my friends through the drive thru, the guy refused to do two separate orders, was rude about it too, no one was behind us. And he forgot the ranch I paid for last minute. I will never go back while he is working , I'm an ex mcdonalds worker and never acted like that or else I'd get a write up / termination because they are not looking for rude people !


Review 6: I came here to order a big Mac, (hadn't had one in years) and when I got it I kinda noticed it looked like crap so I decided to inspect it. When I did, and I took off the top bun I found that someone took a bite off of my fucking meat Patty!! I mean seriously I always tolerate the crappy service, and the stupid and careless Mexican lady that always takes my orders wrong ( I'm also a Mexican I promise I'm not racist or prejudice) in the mornings at the drive-thru, but c'mon seriously someone took a bite off of my fucking meat Patty!! I took it back to the register, and informed the cashier of my surprise, and he was kind enough to replace it for another Big Mac. I brought it back to my table, and I took it out of it's box, and guess what? It looked like shit! Seriously this thing looked so bad I wouldn't be surprised if it fucking winked at me! It looked as if an elephant had sat on it after it had finished taking a slim dump between two hamburger buns. Okay, now I know McDonalds isn't a five star restaurant, and I definitely know it isn't even a quality restaurant, but can't the customer at least expect some service quality? I mean seriously I couldn't even expect to receive a semi-attractive decent tasting burger or a Big Mac with its Patty as a whole. Ugh.. what can you do right?  GOD BLESS AMERICA


Review 7: Omg this McDonald's is so rude, they don't smile and they look like they hate everyone. They always get my order wrong and I've been there only 3 times. Don't go here bad customer service.

Review 0: The remodel was long overdue, and it's super fancy. The pictures speak a thousand words. Also service has been great here!


Review 1: I normally wouldn't write up a chain restaurant, but I have to say my dining experience was very much enhanced by the recent renovation.  They went from a classic drive-in setup where you place your order at the window and dine in your car or in their outdoor seating to a true "McCafe" complete with faux blue chandelier, ultra-modern bathroom doors and interior decor, and bright high definition animated menus which would make Marty McFly (see what I did there?) wonder if he set the wrong year on his Delorean going from his mother Lorraine's time in 1956 to 2016.  There's a service monitor that displays the order number brightly and service was prompt and courteous.  I ordered Le McRib with a side of pomme frites and sweet tea (or as I may one day learn to call it, liquid diabetes) and in a simultaneously comforting and disturbing way, all items tasted identical to how I always remembered them.  Drive-through is very accessible off of Flamingo but if you need to get back heading toward the strip, U-turn is now mandatory off of Eastern.


Review 2: I'm not sure if it was just a bad day or if it's always been like this, but the service needed some work. Only one register open Witham long line of customers. Orders took really long and many were wrong. One customer returned get order 3 times until they got it right. Those with small orders had to wait am excess amount of time. Seemed as though drive-thru customers were top priority, while customers inside were unimportant.


Review 3: It's about time they re-did this place. I mean, how many McDonald's that are out there that are just straight up drive thrus that are wildly popular and successful? None if any.  ...  ... So why this review for a chain? Well, since it's new I wanted to check it out and get my McRib grub on since it only comes around every so often. You would think the service would be nice just like the building but here's where the needle on the record scratches off the vinyl. ...  ... First thing, I get in line behind one person that is waiting to order their food. A couple minutes go by and finally after the just the one counter person calls out somebody's order, he takes the person's order that is in front of me. So after that order, he leaves to go get it ready while I'm standing there waiting to get my order in. Btw, this was lunchtime around 11:30 so there is a line already forming. You would think that there would be at least 2 to 3 people at the counter for the lunch rush but no. This one guy was doing the same thing over and over again. ...  ... So I finish meal and throw away my mess. I go to the bathroom to wash my hands. I come back out to get a refill on my coke. This employee refilling the soda lids asks me if I have my receipt so I can get my refill. I reply saying that I just got done eating and just came from the bathroom. The receipt is in the garbage. He says I can't get a refill. EXCUSE ME? DID YOU NOT JUST SEE ME SITTING AT THE VERY TABLE YOU JUST CLEANED? So I got my refill after the guy says he was gonna report me to his manager. I said go ahead so I can complain about the bad customer service. He just stood there and continued to refill the lids for the soda. I should of said, "Do you know who I am? I am Roger T and I'm a Yelp Elite damnit! You better recognize!" Lol. ...  ... Anyways, just because it's a new building does not equal to great or better service. Next time, just give me my damn McRib and I'm out!


Review 4: This place has recently been rebuilt which is nice, but the men's bathroom is something else, super dirty! Trash cans in the restaurant are are always overflowing and there's always Hobo's hanging out in there, staff is slower than usual, order accuracy levels are in the toilet!

Review 0: If you're looking for a classy restaurant to take a date; this is the place!  There is ample seating available and the hosts are pleasant.  They even assign numbers to the menu in case you can't pronounce the exotic food names.  I had this dish called a "Big Mac" - thank god for the numbering system because I couldn't pronounce that.   ...  ... My "Big Mac" was served in some sort of box - almost like a broke down Japanese Bento Box. There were two beef patties and a bunch of accoutrements.  It was amazing!  The beef patties had the texture of a bunch of crumpled newspapers - yummy!  The sauce?  Don't get me started on the sauce!  There are no adjectives to accurately describe the deliciousness. ...  ... The best thing about McDonalds?  The fact that I was hungry again three hours later!  It's like you can eat a mountain of food and your body just digests it instantaneously - almost like there's 0 nutritional value.  I would totally recommend this place to a friend!


Review 1: By far one of the fanciest McDonald's I have ever been in. They had two flat screen TVs, fancy booths and chairs, and an art piece made out of glass.  ...  ... I decided to stop by here for a quick bite to eat. I ordered the McBites...the McBites are not that great, they are way too breaded. I guess I'll just stick to my McNuggets next time.  ...  ... The staff was very friendly and the service was fast.


Review 2: I stopped here today to get a salad and a shake.  They have a setup for the drive through I've never seen before.  Because of the limited driveway space, the entrance splits into two drives, both of which have ordering areas.  This allows the cars to get into the drive through section quicker and not block traffic in the shopping center. ...  ... Service was fast and polite, and the wait for the food was minimal.  They have free wifi at this location and I saw a sign about two nights of jazz by a live singer in their McCaf on two nights in December.  I wish I could make one of the nights just to try it out.  Sounds like fun! ...  ... Since this is a new McDonald's that opened within the past few months and it's only about 2 miles from home, I'll be stopping at this location more often.  Way to go, McDonald's staff!


Review 3: I'm a HUGE fan of McDonald's period, (yea I know it's sad, lol) but I very much enjoy coming to this location because it's clean and modern. Love the decor. Came a few days ago to order a happy meal for my daughter and OMG! I loved the Wizard of Oz toys, sooo adorable. Anyways, all I ordered was the pumpkin pie which I was not to fond of, the apple pie is way better and the PSL. The PSL was way too sweet even with the nonfat milk but my biggest thing was that they couldn't even fill it to the top!!. Either way, I know I'll be back, may not be for their PSL but definitely for the food.  :-)


Review 4: So I felt like being naughty and getting a cheese burger, however, once I looked at the menu I saw they had a wrap and thought to myself "humm a wrap sounds good."  ... So that is exactly what I got. I remember years ago they had those snack wraps and that is what I was expecting size wise.  ...  ... They have 3 different kinds chicken bacon ranch, chicken ranch, and a sweet chili one. I opted for the ranch grilled chicken, it had lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers, giant pieces of chicken, wrapped in a soft pillowy flour tortilla.  ...  ... FIRST let me say not was I wrong about the size. This thing was MASIVE. I also got the combo so medium fries and a drink. Of course I ate my fries first then dug into the wrap and it wasn't bad, I actually liked it. I could only eat about half of it though because of those stinking fries I was full.  ...  ... I went about a week later and tried the sweet chili one with grilled chicken and like it even more. This time I just got the wrap since there was no need for a combo, I knew it would fill me up. I also really liked the way they boxed up the wrap its in a cool container that  makes it easy to eat.


Review 5: This is a McCafe location. One of the nicest Mc Donald's I've ever seen. ...  ... I visit this location frequently. I've never been disappointed. ...  ... The Ambiance is awesome! The decor is very modern and artistic. The dining room is always clean, and well stocked with utensils, napkins, ketchup, plastic lids and straws. ...  ... The service has always been good when I've visited. My wife had an issue once, and it was resolved. ...  ... It's in a great location with very easy entrance and exit access. It's near the 215 freeway. ...  ... It's the location I visit the most.

Review 0: This McDonald's is located at the food side entrance of the Nellis at Craig Walmart Super Center.  ...  At the time that I stopped in Walmart on the way to Utah, I ate breakfast here. This McDonald's exceeded my expectations. I expected a shoddy McDonald's in one of the Las Vegas valley' s older super centers. Instead, I was eating in a clean and surprisingly cozy McDonald's. I am under the impression that it was recently refurbished. The interior shows off McDonald's history through portraits of the first McDonald's. The booths are extraordinary comfortable for  a McDonald's. Disparate from a few Las Vegas Valley Walmart McDonald's, this location offers more breakfast items. Including the egg McMuffin. ...   On my visit, they served me the egg McMahon meal in a short period of time. The coffee was hot. And I left satisfied. ...   Keep in mind that I ate here around 9:45 AM, before the Saturday morning rush. So, I have not seen how this McDonald's is when there is a rush of people.


Review 1: Kids playplace smells awful and there is food everywhere.  Will never go there except the drive thru.  Drive thru staff is very pleasant and polite, but it doesn't make up for the messy playplace.


Review 2: No, just no. I understand that the food I order will never ever come out like it looks in the picture, but gadaam, don't mean you gotta give me burnt buns on both my mcdoubles. Women, I told you no pickles.. and what did I get?? Probably the largest slices in the bunch. Now I get it's  morning... your tired.. well I'm tired too! When I say good morning at the window I expect some kinda of acknowledgement.

Review 0: This is a large, relatively modern-looking mcds. Its a bit grimy, which in mho, kind of defeats the purpose of the remodel. Why bother making it all pretty & modern if youre not going to wipe it down regularly? ...  ... The service here is ok. Food is standard mcds fare.  ...  ... The one reason we come here is for the HUGE four-story play area. The kids enjoy exploring it, and i enjoy getting a half hour of sanity.  theres a small space underneath for littler guys to play in, but this playplace is realistically more for older kids who can climb well.  ...  ... The kids room is completely closed off from the rest of the restaurant, which works great at keeping my boys from running off, and theres a separate bathroom in here just for aparents.  No changing table, which for some strange reason seems to be the way las vegas restaurants roll. I really hate that.  ...  ... Therefore they shouldnt be surprised when i change a poopy diaper on one of their posh bench seats since theres nowhere else to do it. ... Maybe then they'll wipe it down afterwards... But dont count on it.


Review 1: Alright, so the service here is sometimes good or bad just like any other place. It's pretty clean and has nice air conditioning. What bothers me about this location are some of the employees. They really need to learn proper etiquette... not only for others, but for themselves too. You won't get far ahead in life if you treat people rudely... They're so lucky to have employed that one lady.. She's a new face there and she has such good manners. Also this other employee was super nice too. I went to get some coffee in the morning and it was pretty crowded. The lady was calm and so friendly, idk how she was able to keep a big smile on her face on such a busy day. But overall, most of the employees there just need to learn proper etiquette and not fake it. AND ALSO, I forgot to mention this major thing.. Always check if your order is all good and you have everything. They tend to mess up your orders and forget things.. And they don't even apologize. Rude. ...  ... Like this one time they messed up my order and I was the only customer there....


Review 2: This place is terrible. It's a 50/50 chance that they will get your order right. Maybe if they could hire people who spoke a word of English, they would get your orders right. ...  ... I was JUST there. I wanted a coffee with no whip cream and extra caramel. Super easy, right? Apparently not. They put extra whip cream, barely any caramel. I paid extra for it, so I asked them to remake it. The girl did, but tried to give it to me with, again, barely any caramel. I explained that I asked for extra and even paid extra. She got an attitude with me, then walked away. Another girl asked her what she was going and said, "MORE f***ing caramel!?"  ...  ... So sure as shit, the girl had to be a smart ass and put as much caramel as she could. Literally, the entire bottom was filled half an inch up of caramel. I couldn't help but laugh. What an immature and ignorant staff. I will never go here again. This place is a complete dump. I will definitely be contacting the district manager, because the manager here is a joke and doesn't take anything serious.

Review 0: cara is best!!!!!


Review 1: I can't believe no one has mentioned the African decor in this McDonald's.  It's different and wacky and I kind of love it.  Star! ...  ... Stopped here because Boy needed to use bathroom right away.  Bathroom clean.  Star! ...  ... Manager kind of reminds me of my nephew. Star! ...  ... Boy wanted Cookies 'n Cream ice cream.  Ordered McFlurry with Oreos.  Star! ...  ... Boy having fun in Playland.  Star! ...  ... Dude sleeping in corner with head on table.  Negative star. ...  ... Other than that, it's McDonald's, so what do you expect? ...  ... I haven't eaten at a McDonald's in a long time, so I was kind of surprised how hard it is to read the menu.  What with all the new menu options and having to show calories and pictures, there is too much info to fit on the board.  I felt like I needed to sit down with a paper menu to take it all in.


Review 2: I needed to male a quick stop for a drink before going to a show late last night.  I stopped here, and it was quick and easy.  i was in an out in no time at all. ...  ... Very efficient staff.  It was 11:15 PM, so there weren't many customers.  Still service was great!


Review 3: Waiting 10 minutes, still haven't gotten my order, I thought this was supposed to be fast food?


Review 4: I ordered two double cheeseburgers. When I got home, I found that the burger had no cheese, nor onions, ketchup, or pickles. Confused, I looked back at the receipt and it said two double cheeseburgers with no specifications and they charged me full price! Never going here again.


Review 5: yuck.......Is it me or has McDonalds food gotten smaller & grosser? ... I saw they had the McRib making a limited time comeback so I was feeling all nostalgic and thought I'd give it a go. ...  ... Big mistake..worse than any school lunch pork patty-by the 3rd bite I was already nauseous. How does McDonalds stay open the food is sooo terrible and its not even cheap anymore. ...  ... Do quality food establishment have to have a drive-thru because people have gotten so lazy they will eat any damn thing as long as they don't have to get off their asses to do it.

Review 1: Discusting & Dirty!!!  If it weren't for my Gson I would have left. I took pictures I hope you can see what's going on here.


Review 2: It's 2 for 1 review day!  I can't review the Walmart without reviewing the McDonald's that resides inside.  And boy is it some tantalizing stuff. ...  ... I try not to give too many 1-star reviews but this McDonald's so deserves it.  I hardly frequent a McDonald's at all (although this is my second McDonald's review in less than a week) but I need to let the peeps in on this one.  No Yelper should go unwarned.   ...  ... Of course I came to McDonald's since I have those coupons for their new contraption, the McWrap.  Which when I pronounce very fast and in my Scottish accent sounds much like 'McCrap'.  After my second go round with this thing, I have made up my mind it is decidedly so.  I need to write McDonald's execs to change the name on this thing immediately. ...  ... My coupon for the day was buy a medium fries and a medium drink, get a McWrap of your choice for FREE.  I have a hard time resisting free.  I'm here to tell you...WORST ALMOST FREE MEAL OF MY LIFE!!!  Seriously. ...  ... It was the tail end of lunchtime so the line was still a bit busy.  I patiently waited for almost 10 minutes...which is like forever in McDonald's time.  At least two folks left the line while I was there.  I know it's not McDonald's fault, but the couple in front of me took up majority of the line space because they were in motorized wheelchairs.  And they were very loud.  This doesn't bother me much.  But...they were also very stinky.  Yes, stinky.  I have no problem with stinky in most cases (I occasionally help the homeless so I know) but the guy in front of me hadn't washed in DAYS if I were to guess.  To each his own, and I know it's almost summer so I know we all want to save water...but DAMN.  If I get a whiff and I have to take a step back?  You might be S-T-I-N-K-Y.  But who am I to judge?  I took a big step back and waited my turn.  Free is the motivation here.  I finally get up there to the McDonald's cashier and present my coupon to the guy.  He takes a look at it and says 'We don't usually take the promo coupons at this location but we'll let you use it."  Then he proceeds to put the coupon onto a stack of...more coupons!  Mind boggling to say the least.  He takes my order of a medium fries and medium drink, asks me what type of McWrap I want (Grilled Chicken & Bacon) and rings me up.  $2.91 later I'm given my receipt and asked to wait for my number to be called. ...  ... I wait.  And wait.  #1!  #2!  #3!  #5!  #6!  #7!  #8!  Obviously I'm #4 and 10 minutes later I am still waiting.  Honestly, what the Hell are you guys doing back there?  Mixing the masa for my fresh pressed tortilla?  Feathering a chicken?  Perhaps ripening a tomato?  I ask the McDonald's runner and he tells me, "We're waiting for your McWrap."  Of course. ...  ... At this point I'm almost running late to be back at work, so the minute I get my order I bolt back to the office and have lunch at my desk.  Thankfully I'm only three minutes away.  I really, really should have just gone to the vending machine or eaten my stash of Reese's chocolate peanut butter eggs from last Easter.  Talk about disappointment!  I take out my McWrap from my bag and lay down the box of fries on my desk.  I continue working while munching away on what is supposed to be McDonald's claim to fame.  Their golden fries.  I bite into one, eh a bit stale.  I bit into another one, eh not enough salt.  I bite into yet another one, eh cold??  I look down, and whaddaya know?  My damn fry is not even barely cooked!  White like Olivia Wilde in the winter.  I look through the entire box and find at least half a dozen fries not cooked properly!  Not golden brown!  Not delicious!  Barely out of their frozen state, and just limp.  Not acceptable!  Please check my pic for proof of this travesty.  McDonald's not doing their fries right is like IKEA not serving their Swedish Meatballs with gravy.  NO BUENO. ...  ... After getting over this somewhat I finally hit my stride to go on to my Grilled Chicken & Bacon McWrap.  Wow, talk about lightning striking twice.  This thing was lifeless!  After unwrapping this beast (the box is still the best part about this McWrap), I could just tell something was off.  Tortilla was already showing signs of being soggy way too long.  The chicken peeking out of the top was not looking tip top shape either.  After some hesitation, I took a bite.  UGH I say, UGH!  Freshness was not part of the gameplan for this McDonald's today.  All cold and soggy!  And upon all, my McWrap wasn't built correctly!  Instead of having Spring Mix like it's supposed to, there was plain old shredded iceberg lettuce!  And my bacon was missing!  In the words of our Lord Darth Vader....NOOOOOOOO!  It was McCrap through & through.  Totally upset over this one.  I have picture proof of this travesty of gourmet eats as well.   ...  ... McDonald's you have pissed off the wrong fatty.  I will definitely be calling your hotline to complain about this one for sure.  Knowing my luck I'll get a coupon for a free McWrap.  CRAP.

Review 0: Great crew, and super fast service. Bicyclist friendly too! This McDonald's is also the cleanest I've ever been in. If I lived closer, this would be my regular spot.


Review 1: Peppermint mocha is yummy!


Review 2: I know you are probably wondering how a McDonald's can get a four star rating and to be quite honest I'm thinking the same thing. However, I will explain. I've been here numerous times, as it is convenient and an easy way to grab a quick meal or pretty good iced coffee. Usually there is a lenghty line at the drive through, but it always seems to go quick. Our lastest visit was no exception. After getting a sample of the Mighty Wings earlier in the day, I had made up my mind early to grab some for dinner. I was simply amazed, as they were much better than I could ever have imagined. A three piece will cost you three bucks, but they get less expensive as you buy in bigger quantity. When we got to the window, we were asked to pull off to the side, as the wings were not done yet. We waited only a short time before our wings came out hot and fresh. We were given a coupon for a free order of fries on our next visit, as a result of having to wait. They have offered a coupon every time we have had to wait, which cannot be said for other establishments. I would highly recommend the Mighty Wings and give high praise to my local Mickey D's for the fast, friendly service during the dinner rush.

Review 0: This location is close to the local University and has sliding glass entrance doors. This is a highly frequented location, but for some reason it doesn't get the location service love. ...  ... It has WiFi and would be a good spot to get some email finished or to watch a few videos. There isn't a lot of seats but the drink refill station is central.


Review 1: I get coffee here (sometimes). I haven't died (yet). It's a good start.


Review 2: It's a Mc Donalds in a theorhetically good location, but getting into the driveway is awkward. The food isn't exceptional in the realm of MCDs and the two speed mountains when leaving the drive through are minor foibles. But what bums me out is the fries. This location never seems to have (and/or give me) fresh fries. Its amazing how the degredation of a McDonalds french fry goes so quickly from delicious wonder,  to cake candle garbage in minutes. Meh.


Review 3: It's McDonalds, not a class establishment to begin with. This one was a little dirty and not efficient with it's service. Waited a very long time for food during a not so busy time.


Review 4: I gave it 1 star for their service. I was there around 6 a.m. and not very busy at all. I ordered 2 breakfast sandwiches at the intercom and by the time I got to the window I decided I wanted to add drinks as well. The guy at the window gave off an attitude and said for future reference place your complete order back there. I said I'm sorry, I didn't want drinks originally but decided on it when I got to the window, besides I'm paying for them. He repeated himself again, for future reference place your order back there. What would you do? Would you have stuck around? 'Cuz I didn't. Good thing I didn't give him my money. I wonder what the owner would think if he knew he lost a sale and maybe more since I'm telling you?


Review 5: Ordered at the drive through, heard the lady take my order correctly and even say out loud to the food preparers the order. Got my order and it was incorrect. Went inside and asked for my order to be fixed. As I waited there was a guy standing next to me also waiting for an order to be fixed. He got his and walked away shaking his head. I then heard the cashier tell the manager, "man, customers today..." That's when I then decided to say i just wanted my money back. Very unprofessional. As I walked away from it all I realized he didn't even give me the correct change back. He shorted me $0.65. Never going back and will be calling the higher ups.


Review 6: The manager during the shift this morning seemed rather rude to one of his employees, an older man who looked like he was still learning, and the manager had little to no patience, constantly snapped at him and was also rushing ME to the point where I felt uncomfortable even asking for ketchup. And I was only given ONE napkin inside my utensil packet. Only came here because it's right beside the school, otherwise, I'd have gone elsewhere.

Review 0: Great service!! The folks at counter were really friendly and the layout at this location was really nice (comfortable chairs with and decent LCD).


Review 1: The renovation is good but the best part is the change of management. It has made all the difference in the world. The orders are now coming out correct. Thanks for the changes


Review 2: The food...It's McDonald's.  I go to this location because of the shaded outdoor seating.  Unfortunately they only have two tables outside.


Review 3: They recently remodeled this place and it looks awesome! The only concern I have is, the seating area. I came here for breakfast a few times and stand around for somewhere to sit down.....


Review 4: This McDonald's is super clean and cozy since they did a complete renovation inside and out. Normally I would not take the time out to complete a Yelp review for this establishment however this location is really nice! It has that College lounge relaxing atmosphere that is welcoming for students and all who want some chill time. Nice comfy cushy black pleather chairs and small intimate tables, colorful art on the walls, easy to relax, eat, study, or use their wi-fi for Internet access. ...  ... All you can drink serve yourself fountain drinks are always a plus at McDonald's! The only thing is they do not keep the fresh brewed iced tea or sweet tea out like other locations do so you will have to ask for refills on that.  ...  ... The food is good and the staff is fast and ready to go with your order!


Review 5: it's a toss up for this location and the one on the strip across from four seasons for worst McDonald's. every time I come to this location no matter what I order a large order for three or just a ice cream cone the wait time is horrible. sometimes you'll pull up to the speaker and it takes forever for someone to say anything and start taking your order. there's prob one or two workers in drive thru that do a ok job. I've had my order messed up here multiple times also


Review 6: Mediocre at best. Quality of service is so mundane and unprofessional. I always come in to study since this McDonald's  seems like a nice and quiet place to study after-hours, but the associates here are loud, and sometimes get out of hand. You tend to overhear all the at-work drama and complaints of the workers.  ...  ... It's barely midnight and they apparently shut off their ice cream machine and don't tell you until you're ready to pay. Seriously, what McDonald's has their ice cream machine shut off? Oh and my apple pie was cold AF from sitting too long and previously over-browned from baking too long. How do they manage to do that?! ...  ... Two stars for having guests feel awkward during their dine-in and two stars for their inadequate system of delivering less than ok food.


Review 7: Slow and rude at this location, poorly managed store.


Review 8: Worst service I have received.   When I got here around 545am there were 3 waiting and nobody up front.  There was 1 lady wearing a blue shirt who seemed to be doing EVERYTHING even though there were other employees working, she was the ONLY one with a sense of urgency to help guests!   English in here is a foreign language even in front of guests, they don't care.  The only bright spot to this place in the morning is the lady wearing blue and other times a very nice black man who came in at 6am, he is always pleasant and courteous.   NOBODY ELSE SEEMS TO GIVE A DAMN!!!


Review 9: Wow never in a million years o would think I'll review a McDonald's BUT I had such a horrible experience at this very particular location literally few hours ago (07/28 12:10am-12:50am) when trying to order through the drive-thru, it fckn took them almost a fckn hour! I left before I even had a chance to order, I got so fed up and even 2 cars behind us left as well. What's even more frustrating is the idiot at the very last window (where u were supposed to make an order) was just casually talking to the first car in front of us for nearly 45 min, NOT even bothering to tell us whether there was something wrong because the wait was just too fckn long! Fck ur terrible service!!!

Review 0: HOW SAD! If you yelpers don't give Mcdonalds 5 stars you are on crack this place is Gods gift to the world! Long live the Big Mac!


Review 1: I love McDonald's... Duh but I'm eating my mcchicken and the bun is hard which usually happens after 9pm anyways! Oh well I also ordered Big Mac and 20 pc. Chicken nugget... When we got to the window I asked for various sauces including an "Asian sauce" but the guy at the window took total offense and copped an attitude with me. He asked if I meant sweet chili sauce?? I felt like I may have upset him for some reason (but we are all ppl and I wouldn't have been insulted if he asked me for white sauce!! LoL) so I said sorry and that I meant the Kung pao sauce. But he said that didn't exist and was a dick! I'm glad I didn't ask for gay sauce. Ha! Dude come on. Ppl r ppl. It is what it is!!


Review 2: No milk for the coffee. Only cream. No wonder everyone is fat. Get my coffee, and it's half full. Awesome.  ...  ... All in all, all Micky D's in Vegas suck. ...  ... On a side note, the new oatmeal is pretty damn good.


Review 3: I'm drunk, I come here and order a hot and spicy ( sub The mannaise  with Mac sauce) and 2 breakfast burritos. Tell me why I didn't get any hot and spicy??? What the fudge???


Review 4: This place is infamous for having a rude cashier and not having things in stock. Complaints to management here go on deaf ears. I go out of my way to go to the one on Durango cause of so many bad experiences here- this location really gives the brand a bad name!

Review 0: They have signs posted telling you that you are only allowed 30 minutes to consume your food and then you must vacate... that seems a bit pushy.


Review 1: If I could give this place zero stars I would !!! They do not train staff in guest service and the management is horrible . When I am not near a Starbucks I like to come here sometimes for their iced coffee, they have never got my order right and never been compelled to fix my order or give me a refund . One day me and hubby were in a rush in the morning and grabbed " breakfast " when we got Into the car we look inside of our bag and we have all lunch items. We go back inside to correct our order and we are informed that breakfast is over and there is nothing they can do. They proceeded to take our name down and told us we could grab free breakfast the next day. Next morning comes around and we go to get our breakfast. We are told that our names are not in the book and again there's nothing they can do !? I mean it's mcdonalds but please have some pride in what you do!?


Review 2: The worst service ever. And I'm not a rude person, at all. I said "please" and "thank you." And I absolutely was not greeted whatsoever. Whoever that dumbass lady was, that was working needs to take that stick out of her. Don't be mad at me 'cause you hate YOUR job, bitch. Let's not forget that everyone is REPLACEABLE, including your miserable self. It took every bit of me not to cuss her out. I'd write a letter to corporate but she did not give me a receipt. Go figure right. I'm not one to talk down on people that works fast food because it's not in my character to knock someone's hustle. But she really needs to get it together. And for that, I will NOT ever return to this McDonald's ever again. Some bullshit. Oh. And. Not only did I not get a receipt... I didn't get a straw. And instead of 10 piece chicken nuggets, I got 9. What in the fucking fuck..... Fuck that McDonalds.


Review 3: Went there just to get coffee in the morning and the one thing I need in the morning COFFEE was apparently out of order.


Review 4: Worst McDonald's ever bad costumer service cold burgers cold fries the manager lady is the biggest B**** I have meet,  the people that work there are slow and dumb I think I rather drive out of my way than come here.


Review 5: Worst McDonalds EVER!!!!!!!!!! They are unable to get an order correct, Went through the drive through last night got home and no Fries in my bag. Got to the window and the woman running the window was talking about her personal life with a co worker laughing it up with her back t us making us wait instead of giving us our ice coffee. Then she seemed to remember she was working and brought us our coffee. Last time I went there I ordered something with no mayo which my tix said... got home and covered in mayo. called up to complain and the response...What do u want me to do about it??? If I get the craving for Mcdonald's I will drive out of my way.. I hope this one goes out of business....  This location is good for nothing

Review 0: This Mcdonalds has a lounge area. It seems to be that all these mcdonalds have transformed from kids playgrounds to these fancy cafes. I guess it's cool and all except for, what happens to my future kids childhood memories?  ...  ... So, every morning I get before the 10am mark.. I like to grab my number 2. The sausage egg Mcmuffin. I always like to add strawberry jam to it. But here's why I only gave em 4 stars.. They're so tight fisted with their jam. Like they only have 6 left and they gotta store the rest up for the summer or something.


Review 1: I like this place.. Its sort of near my house.. I just don't like that they close so early..


Review 2: It's McDonalds!


Review 3: The most inefficient McD's I've ever been in! 3 middle management people in different color Uniforms standing around, telling two employees to do everything, while they talk it up in the hallway. One cashier for a line of 4 + customers, open a line, help that poor kid out! Don't waste your time here, wish I could give it neg stars.

Review 0: Everybody knows whats what when it comes to McDonalds, i would've thought it worthless to write a review for a fast food chain but i particularly had to do this one for a reason. This McDonalds in particular had a customer appreciation thing going on that was great, i can positively say that i hadn't seen it in any other McDonalds. They had daily specials and some of them were pretty good, like 2 Big Macs for five dollars. Unfortunately they aren't having these anymore but i thought it was ver worthy of mentioning. Also, the drive thru for this location is kinda wierd.


Review 1: The managers and cashiers at this mcdonalds have really bad attitudes and the service here is usually unorganized especially the line but other then that each time I come here the food is always fresh so that's a plus but other then that nothing really to write home about.


Review 2: Always messing something up! No cheese..comes with cheese! Order fries..get no fries! Sugar cookies? Don't even ask after 8pm! Get it together!


Review 3: Bad attitudes and rude behavior from both employees, one was the manager. I'll be avoiding this McD's from here on out.


Review 4: I come here unfortunately about 2 times a week. My son has autism and has to have McDonald fries and apple juice. The staff is usually over the top nice or the complete opposite, I prefer the staff that have all their teeth .. really gotta wean my child off fries haha because I seriously hate Mcdonalds

Review 0: SUPER slow drive-thru (even at 10PM!) but the guy at the window made up for it by hooking me up with a couple free frozen lemonade coupons!! No purchase necessary? I'm there!


Review 1: Quick service. Food was hot


Review 2: I'm not a McDonald's eater. Blame Fast Food Nation, blame their rash of bad publicity, or blame common sense, but the "food" here isn't really good and we all know it. That being said, their double cheese burger tastes like childhood and you can't deny that, either. ...  ... I usually stop here to hit up the Redbox machine, but occasionally I'll pop in to grab a treat for my BF or a friend. Somehow, in the handful of times I've gone in, they've always been out of chocolate shakes. And half the time their coffee is lukewarm despite being fresh-made.  ...  ... Without fail, this place is always kind of messy, and their parking lot layout is a disaster waiting to happen- it's small and seems like half the spots are handicap-only, but luckily the lot itself connects on either side to the car wash and the Walmart plaza. Because you can't go to one without going to the other.


Review 3: McDonalds food served by English language challenged people. Enough said.


Review 4: This has got to be one of the slowest drive-thrus I have ever had the pleasure of waiting in line for! I only ordered medium sized french fries and a hot chocolate, and it took at least 20 minutes to finally get my order!  And to top that off, when it was finally my turn at the window, it took them 5 minutes to open the window to tell me that my order will be ready shortly! You may think I am exaggerating, but I am not! Hopefully my next time there will not be as horrendous!


Review 5: I am not a normal patron of McDonald's. I make it a goal in life never to step foot in these nasty soulless establishments, but AMEX was offering 5$ off of 5$, so I went into this place (looks as good as a McD can look from the outside) and as soon as I step foot I notice there are napkins all over the floor like if it was a part of the new tiling scheme or something.  ...  ... I grasp my Chipotle bag a bit closer. Get in queue. ...  ... There is this guy in one of the front-row stools facing the action at the registers that is praying over his poor, chemical/GMO laboratory-concocted excuse for 'food'. I thought I entered one of those live art installations I learned about in Art Appreciation and on World's Dumbest (which my girlfriend watches, not me!). Try to ignore him.  ...  ... Finally, after what seems like fifteen minutes (how is it that Chipotle next door not only took my order immediately, but had my food bagged and charged in less amount of time and it is REAL FUCKING FOOD?), I reach a really short Latina lady that seems like she has zero happiness left in her life and she wishes she was in whichever state in whatever country she is originally from instead of here.  ...  ... "Good afternoon." ... ::weird look:: from the cashier ... "Five dollar gift card, please." ... "Fif dolla." ... "Yes, ma'am." ... I try to hand her my CC in an awkward misunderstanding on procedure at McDonald's in 2012.  ... She points at the self-serve CC machine aggressively angry.    ... Seconds later, I am about to slide my card and she updates me on breaking development: no cards for gift card; cash only. ... "Uh, really. Cancel that then."  ... I walk out in defeat.  ...  ... I have asked around regarding this seemingly concocted policy rule and was told to go to a nicer McDonald's. Well, it's really relative, because there is no such thing as a 'nice' McDonald's, simply varying levels of shittiness accompanying your shit faux-food. - E


Review 6: I wish i had the chance to choose which cashier to help me. I always end up with that rude disrespectful Af-Am lady. Too bad i only had few minutes for my break, and it's close to school. I swear i've tried all the fast food chains around CSN. ...  ... Okay, let's get straight to the point. I always get the worst customer service EVERYTIME she's the cashier. She shouldn't be there. No smiles, no greet, she just takes orders, tell you how much is the damage and would give you a weird look if you give her exact change. ...  ... Recently, i went there again to grab a quick lunch. Same thing did happen! Lol i ordered Mcbites and she forgot to put the sauce in my bag. As i was going through inside my bag, not even knowing something was missing, take note i was holding my bag in my arms, she shoots the sauce inside my bag like a basketball pro and then stares at me like "there's your sauce bitch, you can leave now." Lol it was sorta funny but come on! Say atleast excuse me? ...  ... Never heard any word from her besides, "medium or large?" ...  ... She needs to go back to training or stay in kitchen.


Review 7: This place takes ages to make food, they  tell me the credit card machine isnt working, which is almost every visit. Seems to be a slow and annoying process to obtain fast food!

Review 0: Been to this Mcdees many times. The food has always been fresh, hot, the service prompt and friendly. Clean restaurant and restrooms.


Review 1: Something is fishy about this McDonalds. That is all the fishes swimming in the awesome aquarium in the heart of the dining area. This is no ordinary aquarium. It is an aquatic garden. McDonalds made what would've been an ordinary McDonalds attached to a Chevron into a fun restaurant to dine in. Children seemed amazed by the fish. There are seats arranged around the aquarium, that offer closeup views. For guests who are drinking a beverage, there are more comfortable lounge seats that overlook the aquarium. ...    I was happy with the service, food, and overall experience. ...   BTW, I uploaded two pictures of the aquarium this businesses Yelp page.


Review 2: The food is usually fresh. The only problem is they have some SALTY ass fries. It never fails, no matter what time or day I go they are always super salty. Hate it.


Review 3: What a crappy slow drive thru in the mornings! Because there's 2 order screens, your order can easily get mixed up if stupid drivers cut in front of you.  Bad call McDonald's.   ...  ... Food was slapped on.  But hey, that's why it's fast food.


Review 4: Yeah, I eat at McDonald's. What of it? I am hooked on breakfast sandwiches, okay?  Leave me alone. I don't care if it's a $20 breakfast sandwich from room service or a $3 sandwich from McDonald's. Addicted. ...  ... This particular McDonald's is in a gas station, which is pretty dope. And this is a good stop if you're headed to Lee Canyon for skiing. ...  ... Fish tank!  There is one at this McDonald's. Say again, fish tank!

Review 0: These guys are great.  They rarely mix up or make errors on orders. Drive thru moves quickly. Staff is friendly and professional.  My favorite mcd in the NW.


Review 1: Been to this location repeatedly.  Almost always a good experience.  Nothing to write home about, but the drive thru is fast and my order is almost always right.  Customer service is average...sometimes stellar, but usually just acceptable. We've never had any problems. Food is good.  Employees are polite.


Review 2: I stop by this MCD's drive thru often when I'm on my way to/from the Clark County Shooting Park. This one is fast and my order has never been messed up. I pull up, order, pay and am off with my food. Never have to wait around much, which is exactly the point of going to a fast food joint.


Review 3: The woman over the drive-through mic was pleasant and had a good sense of humor. She informed me of the coffee special and $1 coffee makes me very happy. ...  ... That was it. I wanted fast, in & out coffee and got great service and a good product at a good price.  ...  ... I don't really eat fast food, but if I was going to, I would go back to this McDonalds.


Review 4: I use to work at the Costco in front of this McDonalds so it was pretty much my sole food option for lunch at work. I am worn out on this food for a decade or two, but the service was always pretty good, and the drive thru was always really fast, so ther's not much to complain about here.


Review 5: On my way home after ending my work day late on the eve of my Christmas vacation I decided to celebrate (and fill my empty stomach) with a quick snack.  I wasn't to excited to go to a McDonalds in between a Costco and WalMart especially on Christmas week, but I was pleasantly surprised the place was not over crowded.  I went through the drive through because I was anxious to get home and relax.  Although there was 3 cars in front of me I made it through quickly.  Had something to do with both Drive-thru windows open and the dude taking the order was competent and friendly. ...  ... I ordered a Mint Mocha with my fries (strange combination I know) and it was delightful.  Could have been a little bit hotter, but other than that it was enjoyable. ...  ... Overall I have a pleasant experience at this MD's.  A rare occurrence these days.


Review 6: Was Starvin' like Marvin yesterday morning and went to the drive thru to grab something on the way to an early morning meeting.  While I don't eat at McDonald's too often, this one in particular was impressive....why?  Well, for starters they open both drive thru windows, which makes it go 2x faster.....many fast food places no longer open the second window and it takes forever to get through. ...  ... I ordered 2 Sausage McMuffin Sandwiches and a Bottle of Water.  The service was quick, the food was hot and fresh.  What more could I ask for? ...  ... Will I return?  Next time I'm in a pinch for breakfast, you bet!


Review 7: I recognize that after midnight might appear to be late, but c'mon, guys, this is Las Vegas!  After having dinner on the Las Vegas Strip and catching Jubilee at the Flamingo, my wife and I decided to cap off date night with an ice cream cone and hot apple pie from McDonalds on the way home. ...  ... No dice.  Despite the long line at the drive thru, we were informed that the ice cream machine was down.  No problem, we thought, just give us our hot apple pies and we'll take a latte to share. ...  ... Now, the fact that the package the apple came in read "Caution: HOT!" led me to believe that the apple pie would actually be, you know, hot.  My handy dandy insta-read thermometer informs me that the actual temperature of my "HOT!" apple pie is actually 70 degrees Fahrenheit.  If I convert this temperature to Kelvin, THEN  it seems to be hot, but on both the Fahrenheit and Celsius scales this seems to be sorely lacking. ...  ... C'mon guys.  It doesn't seem to much to ask that the "HOT!" apples pies at least be warmer than body temperature.  Given the fact that the line for the drive-thru was at least 10 cars long when we arrived, I assume that there was enough turn-over in your food inventory to ensure that the products you were selling were fresh and hot.  I am disappointed with this experience!


Review 8: I stopped by this McDonalds yesterday to pick up breakfast for my wife and son. To find when I get home that they had not given me half my order. Being in a time crunch I decided to call, The manager acknowledge that they knew they had left things out on accident and so i tried to tell them to refund my card but I was told they could not do that and that if I wanted to I could come in the next morning and they would give me what they had forgot to give me. I was not happy about having to go back but I did. Now I'm even more unhappy after going there this morning and trying to get what they forgot to give me. The manager was rude and acted like I was wasting her time to get my food that they had forgot to give me. So after giving me some cold mcmuffins, no apology  and could not even offer me a free cup of coffee for my major inconvenience. I left and will never go back to this McDonald's. I know people make mistakes but it's how you correct those mistakes and the customer service you give when you make a mistake that matters. Corporate needs to help this McDonald's get it together!


Review 9: I understand that this is a McDonald's, so what did I expect? I used to work in this shopping center so I ended up at it a shameful amount. They have always, always been a hot mess.  ...  ... Still, I always seem to forget and give it another chance, but I had the worst fast food experience of my life here a few weeks ago.  ...  ... It was about 11:30 p.m. when I pulled into the drive-thru, with 4 cars ahead of me. I place my order and pull up a little bit. That was the last time I moved for the next 20 minutes. It is not an exaggeration. The drive-thru is set up so that there is absolutely no way you can get out of it once you're in it. I was trapped in this stupid drive-thru for what felt like an eternity, and I hadn't even paid. ...  ... When I finally get to the first window, there is nobody there. After about a minute the girl came scurrying in and had to ask me what I had ordered. Holy. Crap. (As a side note, cashier girl, if you ever read this, I'm sorry I was kind of rude to you. I felt pretty bad about it. It wasn't your fault.) ...  ... Anyway, after finally paying, we're stuck again. While I'm waiting, I can see the food window handing bags and taking them back from the car that's there currently. Great, they're messing up orders. The next car has the same situation. ...  ... I get up to the window and the guy hands me a bag that is very clearly not my food based on the size, but I checked anyway. Nope. I wait for him to come back and tell him, and he grabs the other bag that had been sitting there since before I even got to the window and hands me that one instead. No apology, nothing. He didn't even look inside either of the bags. ...  ... The worst part of all of it is that after this 30-minute journey, my fries were so cold. So, so cold. Hot McDonald's fries are the only reason to go to McDonald's! At that point, I just wanted to get as far away as possible from this place.  ...  ... It should never be so hard to get terrible food. I always go to McDonald's with hardly any expectation, but somehow this one always seems to surprise me. Wait through the light at 215 and go to Burger King instead if you've got a hankering for $1 burgers.

Review 0: After being opened only a couple of days, this is the newest McDonald's to open in the Las Vegas valley. In a few days there will be another McDonald's opening a few miles west at Blue Diamond and Durango. ...  ...   I just happened to have caught this McDonald's act on the way back from hiking. The Blue Diamond Road landscape seems to change every week. New to the landscape is the old familiar Golden Arches sign. After hiking for six hours I was exhausted and needed a snack. ...  ...   Lately my opinion of McDonald's is that it does a better job of filling the void for a light meal, snack, Frape Mocha, or coffee if a coffee shop is not around. To temporarily hold over my appetite and enjoy a beverage besides water that I had been drinking all the day on the hike, I ordered the $1 large Coke and $1 hot & spicy. ...  ...   Being a new McDonalds this location is modern and for now immacuately clean. First off it is a nice first impression when a McDonald's is not part of a gas station, like the one down the road at Blue Diamond and Rainbow. I entered through modern electric sliding doors. There were two managers, and I got a nice greeting. The workers were on top of their game. There were plenty of booths to choose from. The interior is more contemporary than McDonald Land. The McDonald Playland is nonexistent. What does exist is a chandelier and a more elegant lobby. They did not go modern to the point of some restaurants that feature the super Coke machines with a 100 plus flavors. The typical Coke flavors they had were not flat. ...  ...  McDonald's may not be 4 star dining. However, when I just want a snack to fill me up or a Frape Caramel; McDonald's gets the job done.  ...  ... The Daniel. S Yelp 100 Challenge. Review 88.


Review 1: The Drive Thru sucks. I mean the food comes out quickly. And Whether ordering inside or in your car you get it fast. A plus being you can hit the convenience store and get gas or snacks. But literally the drive thru dumps you at the entrance and exit on Rainbow blvd and its hard to get out. And if you come in the wrong way, you have to flip a u turn to get into the drive thru. To late for them to redo it now. I guess when im on that side of town, ill venture inside from now on.


Review 2: This is a prime location for residents of Mountains Edge sitting on such a busy corner.  The fries here are always tasteless and soggy, they are slow to move the drive through along and parking is difficult based on the building configuration.  If I feel like grabbing a #2 value meal I much rather travel to the McDonalds 4 miles North on Rainbow.


Review 3: A shiny, bronzed group of Chicken McNuggets with formed pretend-tatoes in a 4-color box served by a high-school student or college intern and a toy to boot?? From the drive-thru even? Where can I  pay money?? I  want to pay real money for this! And afterward, I  want to gas up my car, yup! Then I  want to play bad vintage top 40 music blasting on my factory car radio system "I  wanna be a cowboy. And you can be my cowgirl." ...  ... I  showed up at 430am looking for a quarter pounder and they were only serving breakfast, even though the sign says differently. Another time I  showed up at 1030am and tried to order breakfast and they stopped serving breakfast. ...  ... I  really think this Mickey D's is cray cray adorbs. 4 r e al z.


Review 4: I have to tell you it's been 2 years since I've been at a McDonalds and all I got was a Coffee Frap, it was gross, felt greasy in my mouth...like their food. Which I haven't eaten in probably 4 years and regretted it then. It's so gross! ... Haven't had a Shamrock Shake in years...it's that time of year and wanted to give it a shot. Used the drive thru, there was hardly a wait. Staff was pleasant but the stench of moth balls was unbearable when they opened the drive up window. Yuk! Thankfully the shake didn't taste like the smell of the store. Not really minty, it was okay, nothing special. I'm over the Shamrock shake.  ... Lets see how long it'll be this time till I make it to another McDonalds.


Review 5: Its a McDonald's attached to a gas station so you cant expect much. Food was ok as you cant screw that up to bad at a franchise restaurant.  ...  ... You do have to put up with the horrible parking lot/ gas station traffic if you park and go in the dinning room is loud/small with tons of little kids running around (no playground for the kids and the parents seem to let them run wild) ...  ... Napkins are by the register not by the the straws or the soda machine so make sure you grab a few when you pay for your meal or you will have to push your way to the front to get them afterwards.  ...  ... There are other McDonalds near by and you are better off visiting one of them.


Review 6: OK. so.  When we first moved here..... We had a bunch of friends visit and come stay at our brand new house back in 2008?  I don't remember... a while back.  But this joint was still fairly new.  We came here on the way to the airport to drop off our weekend guests at the McCarran for a quick bite to eat.   ...  ... [Keep in mind that this is during the summertime] ...  ... So we go in.. and there are flies.  FLIES.  all over the place.  I'm weirded out and the employees are acting like nothings wrong.  I'm not sure what to do at this point and I've suddenly lost my appetite.  So I approach the counter and I ask... what's going on?  And the young man at the counter was at a loss and kinda giving me the "get out of here" look.  So, I made a judgement call and decided that we needed to get out of there.   ...  ... I'm not talking about 1 or 2 flies that the auto door can bring in.  It was like walking through a wall.  ...  ... O_O   ...  ...  ... Next.... I should say that I have been back.  BUT. . .  years later and not after I put in a call to let the proper people know that there was a HUGE problem. ...  ... ... it's not always the cleanest either.  ...  ... I haven't encountered that problem since.... but, still not the first one I'd go to though it IS RIGHT there.


Review 7: This isn't even a legitimate McDonald's... It's a gas station McDonald's! ...  ... I've been to this location twice. Once to meet up a stranger off Craigslist and once to try and redeem my Big Mac LivingSocial coupon. The place is clean, but the location attracts some of the local bums in the area. The smell of urine is simply unappealing. I also tried to redeem my LivingSocial coupon. They wouldn't accept it, because they couldn't find a button on the menu for it. Lame.  ...  ...  A little about my credentials: ... I first got into cooking & food when I was in college. After being rejected by numerous girls and getting zero action, I decided it was time for a change. I needed a new makeover to boost my geeky image. I applied for a cooking position at a Mediterranean-Italian Restaurant near my home and learned to cook all sorts of dishes. I never became a professional chef, but I continue to enjoy & love food. 9 years later and 55 lbs heavier, I have a new passion for traveling and trying different foods around the world.


Review 8: This location is part of a gas station and has not been updated in years. The food is alright but there are always flies flying around in the dinning room which is pretty unappetizing to say the least. You would think someone there would have noticed by now as I have seen the flies on several occasions.


Review 9: This McDonald's is connected to the Terrible's convenience store/gas station and not particularly one of my favorites. ...  ... It's convenient when you're driving down Blue Diamond from the west, but I think the staff could use some training in the customer service end from the other McDonald's nearby. ...  ... The last time we ate there, we watched (and listened) as one of the staff members hollered from the dining area to the kitchen.  Apparently she was on break (and eating) and still wanted to maintain her conversation with her colleagues, so she continued it by screaming across the dining room and they, in turn, hollered back.  Very professional group here. ...  ... I'm sure all the other customers enjoyed the show as well.


Review 10: This place is very hit and miss to me come on it's McDonald's not a five-star restaurant I  understand but classic whoever's working determines on quality of food or them to get your order correct


Review 11: This review is only for the one in Rainbow and Blue Diamond of SouthWest Vegas.  I go here because it's one of the few Mcdees thats open 24hrs.  Menu and taste is the same as the other Mcdees around town.  Would have gotten one more star if they served breakfast before 5am because I went at 4:40am and they were just doing the lunch menu still. They denied me of a good warm hearty breakfast and had to settle for an unhealthy BIG MAC combo with a coke.


Review 12: A first for the gf and I - a visit to McDonald's !  Surprisingly, out of the blue, the gf was recovering from the flu and said she was craving McDonald's french fries.  Before i could get out the door to make a Mickie-D run the gf yells out asking for a filet of fish, " anything else ? " , she calls out for a chocolate shake, too.  Yep, I guess she's feeling better ! ...  ... So i order: ...  ... Large Fries - $2.09 ... Chocolate Shake - $2.79 ... Filet of Fish - $3.79 ... 20 piece chicken nuggets - $4.99 ... Diet coke - $1.00 ...  ... My first thought - dang, Mickie d's ain't all that cheap, $3.79 for a filet of fish ?!  Seems high to me. ...  ... The taste ?  Holy cow - some of the worst food we've had in a very long time !  My guess is the nuggets were sitting out for several hours - we ate 4 of them and stopped.  The fries were limpy, wimpy, limpy.  The filet of fish was ok at best.  Shake was ok.   ...  ... This is a reminder why the only reason i hit McDonald's is for a soda - best value and basically a safe bet !


Review 13: ahhhhh just got home after getting drive thru at this location. i really considered turning around and going back but gave up on the thought. I ordered a spicy chicken sandwich with no mayo and a medium fry with a side of BBQ sauce.  ...  ... heres what i got ...  ... a spicy chicken sandwich with tons of mayo and a broken bun because of all the disgusting white shit everywhere.  ... a medium fry that was literally half full, honestly me saying it was half full was exaggerating, it was about a third full.  ... and guess what no BBQ sauce BUT an open ketchup packet that got everywhere.  ...  ... BRAVO... BRAVO. and this is why i rarely eat fast food.

Review 0: As far a McDonalds go this is the one to visit.  The children's area is beautiful and the restaurant is always super clean.  What stands out though is the fries, they make the best fries of any McDonalds I have been to in the city.


Review 1: Great service, clean and great interiors! It even has a chandelier inside! What more can you say about a fast food joint. You really don't feel like you're eating at a fast food joint inside here.


Review 2: Okay we'll it's McDonald's food but...during lunch they have a person standing outside to take orders. Line was long but I got through in three min. Freaking awesome.


Review 3: The moment I pull up and walk inside I'm thinking...Is this really Mcdonald's?!  It sure doesn't look like the typical Mcdonald's.  It's got a remarkable interior including a chandelier, lounge area,  a centerpiece on each table, clean play area, and flat screen tvs.  Exterior has a water fountain and plants.  Customer service is great.


Review 4: The only McD's I will eat at. Not only is the decor bright and fun and totally unlike any other McD's I've ever seen, but the food is always 100% picture perfect. Everything is always hot, fresh and literally looks like the food they show in the commercials. My burger never appears stepped on or flattened or half wrapped like the other fast food places. I see many other people have already commented on the unique interior and it is very charming and way cooler than any fast food place. I give this location an A+ in every catergory!


Review 5: Thinking too myself why the hell would I ever write review about golden arches because seen one seen them all. SO NOT true about this location. The food need not say anything because its  McDonald classic been around forever still have the best french fries.  ...  ... The main reason for this review is all about the atmosphere and for SURE the interior design. We all think fast food go plastic chairs, maybe run down, no tv, and nothing special or gets ones attention. Not the case with this one! The exterior design who the hell sees water fountain in front of McD. Once get inside they have all these separate areas almost stand out by themselves. Walk in left have wide screen tv area chill out, the one area they have chandelier hanging and nice big widescreen watch with lounge chairs/basically going too starbucks or coffee shop area, even the kids play area nothing like normal ones with the plastic balls or the kids climbing around (it couple turtles kids play around and even mini play house) and walk around lot cleaner kids area then normal ones, and even the soda fountain area two separate ones lots of choices all really clean, and just everything about the place is different. I been too many McD in my lifetime so far and swear never in life imagine McD this nice or really feels more like restaurant then fast food joint. If ever want enjoy the finer McD in life check this one out. Lol!!!


Review 6: This is THE McDonald's that everyone wishes were in their neighborhood.  Probably the newest one in Las Vegas, it definitely sets the bar of what you hope all McDonald's could be like! ...  ... Located on S. Rainbow with its major cross streets being Warm Springs and the 215, it has generated quite a buzz! ...  ... With a flowing fountain to welcome you, the inside feels more like a coffee lounge.  Cool color tones welcomes you to take advantage of their free WiFi and the large TV has you hanging out longer than you normally would.   ...  ... Instead of the typical outdoor play area for kids with those plastic balls (an area rarely ever cleaned), this location has an indoor area that looks like it could be cleaned and inspected on a regular basis.  There's also a few larger tables set aside for what could be private parties - birthday parties at Mickey D's are coming back perhaps? ...  ... Nonetheless, this fast food joint and design are a welcome addition to the neighborhood, even if there's another McDonald's less than a mile away in the Arroyo Crossing shopping center.


Review 7: This location has been renovated with current colors and decor.  Inside you will be surprised to find purple, black and grey as the theme, a small play area for kids and equally kind-to-parents sitting area where those kids can be watched over and still have a conversation.  I can see they are going for a cafe experience and they might have nailed it.   ...  ... Most impressive is the staff at this particular location.  They are clean, polite and look like they are going somewhere in life, not like they could not make it.   ...  ... The food is still poison, and we still crave and submit to it because they have been pumping it into our brains and bodies for decades.  They created an addiction by processing and mutilating food.  But at least you can enjoy it in a new atmosphere.  I'm no stronger than the next person, but I limit my intake.   ...  ... Chow Chow~


Review 8: We are truly blessed to have one of the nicest mcdonalds in town, and only a few minutes away from my home. I don't eat here much anymore, but this mcdonalds is always first on my list whenever I need some food.  ...  ... Thank the foodie gods for this beautiful and CLEAN McDonalds.


Review 9: Best McDonald's ever LOL


Review 10: Oatmeal is delicious


Review 11: What can I say ? I try to avoid eating here, but I am a sucker for their Caramel mocha coffee and an occasional breakfast item. I suggest you try the mocha !


Review 12: Didn't think I'd be reviewing a McDonald's like most people have been saying on here, but I'm finally annoyed enough to write. First off, I walk in and there's a guy texting on his phone behind the front counter and behind the shift lead. If this Corporate location is attempting to make McDonald's look more upscale and professional, then the employees should be the part as well. Texting in front of customers is unacceptable, whether on break or not. If you're on break, you should be using your cell phone in a non-public area, out of view of guests. Second, the shift lead that took my order rang up the wrong special order on my Crispy Chicken Classic because she was distracted by engaging in conversation with co-workers... which should stop completely when a guest is present. I think this location lacks accountability of its employees, and soon, it will become a free-for-all if a stop isn't put to it.


Review 13: rude serviced


Review 14: I stopped by here to grab a quick lunch on my way back to work and when I got to my work I noticed something under my drink lid. Open it and to my surprise it was a dead bug stuck to the lid! GROSS  ...  ... I tried calling to let them know but it just rings and rings and no one answers! Will not be coming back!


Review 15: Never thought in a million years I be writing a review on McDonald's but I thought this visit warranted one.  I have to preface this with the only reason I actually went inside to eat was I was with a friend who has a toddler and the only thing that was going to make him happy was the play land area. Ok here goes, when we first walked in I noticed all the fake plants everywhere, and the fountain, and the bench. Am I at McDonald's or an old ladies house? By far the strangest mcds I've ever been to. Then it gets more interesting, the inside is a poor attempt at making this a hip lounge. With damask wallpaper and a small sitting type lounge area with a cheap chandelier, I couldn't help but laugh. Oh and did I mention the guy passed out sleeping in this "lounge" area? Random men were walking in and out of the restrooms, I truly felt like I was in the twilight zone.  ...  ... Now onto the service, we had a fairly simple order, and not only did they get it wrong not once, but 3 times, and gave us an attitude with it. This isn't rocket science people. Learn to speak English. ...  ... I know why I never go to fast food places now.

Review 0: If I told you that McDonald's was a big factor in my weight loss of 20 lbs last year, you probably wouldn't believe me. Not unless you are one of my coworkers that see me at work every morning eating my Sausage McMuffin and have witnessed my slimmer physique.  ...  ... Well, it's true. Breakfast really is the most important meal of the day and I found that skipping breakfast is not a good idea if you're trying to lose weight/get fit. Even though its not the most wholesome breakfast option, this is the quickest, cheapest way for me to get my morning meal. ...  ... I am not writing anything about McDonald's that you might already know. I'm writing about this particular location. They are always super fast and efficient at the drive thru and every employee I've encountered over the past few years here are very friendly. I come here so often that I should just write a review and give kudos to the Mon-Fri morning crew for always getting my order out fast, quick and in a hurry before heading to work. Even when the drive thru lane is packed, they move it pretty quickly so I've never found myself sitting in my car for more than a few minutes. ...  ... So just in case you're wondering what I order every morning here it is: a sausage Egg White Delight and a medium sugar-free vanilla iced coffee. I automatically throw away one piece of the muffin to save on carbs. I know it sounds crazy but it works. For me, a carb conscious way of life works best. And this keeps me satiated enough until I have to nuke my Lean Cuisine around noon time.


Review 1: Like I have said before, having children makes it nearly a necessary thing to be at McDonalds about once a week. This isn't always for Happy Meals (we prefer home cooked food to fast food always - especially for our kids), but I don't mind treating him with a soft serve cone or a Sprite on the way home from the park, or maybe when he's been really good at the grocery store. They also tend to be a good caffeine fix for me when I don't feel like the Bux.  ...  ... This McDonalds is on the way to "Grandma's House" so we make stops here more frequently than any other on this side of the valley. We've never encountered any problems more than the occassional broken straw here. Employees are generally pleasant. How much better could a Mickey D's get?


Review 2: My son loves to go to the play place, usually the kids are nice, the parents are nice too. Employees are polite for the most part, bathrooms are clean. Sadly this area has more crime each time I come here so I just stopped going.


Review 3: This McDonalds is so close to my place that it's become a task to try not to stop by here on my way home.  So far I have not encountered any problems with either the staff or the food here and the service is still quick.  That's about all I can ask for in a McDonalds.  Keep up the good work.


Review 4: This is a nice McDonald's.  The place is always clean, the staff is friendly, and it usually isn't too crowded, except for the drive thru, which always has a long line any time of day it seems.  The inside seating area is always clean and well stocked. ...  ... I come here with my daughter so she can play in their play area.  She is 18 months and loves all of the climbing this McDs has.  This play area is always nice and clean as well.  In fact when we are there, someone is always cleaning it or just finishing up cleaning the area.  They even go through the tunnels and all.  It is a nice place, especially on those blistering summer days when it is too hot to go to the park. ...  ... My only complaint would be that they hide the sweet tea behind the counter.  I am a sweet tea addicted and it is a little annoying to have to go up to the counter to get a refill, especially when you have to wait in line with everyone ordering.  I need my sweet tea fix and waiting just doesn't count it.   ...  ... Overall, it is a nice McDonald's.


Review 5: Yes, I often indulge myself with the fine cuisine that is found at my local McDonald's.  OK, OK really I try not to go there that often unless it's the only thing to eat or I'm hankerin' for a damn McNugget (which by the way I still HAVE NOT found which part on the chicken the nugget is on).  Addictive with Hot Mustard. ...  ... I went here exclusively this day because of the current coupons that came in the mail.  There were a bunch of decent ones, particularly the ones that are promoting you try the new McCrap...oi...I mean McWrap.  This is almost as catchy as that 'Fishay, Fishay' song from the previous McDonald's food campaign for Fish McBites over the Easter season.  I swear if I see a wall of fish singing this tune to me at any location I will make like Grizzly Adams and run for the hills.   ...  ... I took my McWrap coupon and waltz into my closest McDonald's.  The visit's coupon was for a free McWrap of my choice with the purchase of any menu item (including the $1 Value Menu).  I got me a $1 Sweet Tea (1/2 & 1/2 to avoid extra sugar) to go with my McWrap.  I chose the Chicken & Bacon McWrap, grilled.  Oi, why McDonald's thought this thing could compete with a $5 footlong from Subway I don't know. ...  ... My Chicken & Bacon McWrap was really MEH.  The chicken was ok but was on the cold side, and my bacon?  Damn stuff is the same thing they put on your typical McDonald's breakfast fare.  Skinny and not much flavor.  The chicken was warm enough that it completely wilted the Spring Mix type lettuce in my McWrap.  Either that...or the Spring Mix was not cold to begin with!  I hate that.  Overly soggy lettuce.  Bleech.  The tomatoes that came in my McWrap were warm as well.  Not to mention, I have a feeling my McWrap was made prior to my ordering because the tortilla it came in was showing signs of sogginess too.  Not made fresh me thinks!  These guys and their speed over quality sometimes. ...  ... Taste?  I rather have a wrap somewhere else and pay a bit more.  The flavors just weren't that great to justify a regular price of $4 per McWrap.  If I didn't have this coupon I wouldn't have bothered trying it.  The best part about the McWrap was the damn box it came in!  It was cool & hip, and I felt like I was unwrapping a present when I tore through that seal.  But other than that, nothing.  I would have much rather used the coupon for a free Happy Meal with purchase.  I love those things!  But only when they come in the actual Happy Meal box with the Golden Arches handles, not in a friggin' paper bag.  Grrrrr....I hate it when my Happy Meal comes in a regular bag.  Makes me NOT happy. ...  ... Anyway, this trip to McDonald's was a bit of a bust.  Was hoping to give them a chance with this new fandangled McCrap...darn it there I go again...McWrap, but it just didn't impress me.  If they were made upon ordering and with much fresher ingredients, and not sitting by a heat lamp then maybe it would have been a better experience.  Maybe I should hit up another McDonald's and give this thing another shot.  Well, at least I had a coupon for buy one Dipped Cone, get one free!  I double fisted that sucker all the way home!  Ok, I actually shared for once.


Review 6: Mcdonalds is mcdonalds as far as good goes. What separates them from each other is service. This mcdonalds has nooooo idea what that means. The emergency door was beeping like a smoke detector with a bad battery. Other people were complaining about the same beep, and some got up and left the playroom. Notified the manager of the issue and she acted uninterested and gave me a look of disgust because I bothered her during social hour. I wish I was kidding or exaggerating about her face. The look almost turned me to stone. Bad manager!!


Review 7: Shitty ass fries man!


Review 8: this place blows! the drive thru girl is rude and worried about her moped out front instead of my order! she doesnt like my brittish accent and her boss tells me to be quiet while ordering! what the heck?! screw you alaina!

Review 0: I've been going to this McDonald's for a few years now, they have fast service and good prices. The sweet tea is great and if they do mess up your order they will correct it with no hassles


Review 1: This location is the business. Dude in the drive thru was rapping my order and was cool as heck.


Review 2: C'mon now, who hasn't grown up with Mickey D's? Yeah, we all loved them growing up, but slowly got more health conscious as we grew older....Still can't deny the addicting fries though, gotta have 'em once in the blue moon, and the Mc Rib has a cult following that can't wait until they serve it up again! ...  ... Me? I like their food toys.  The Minions are the coolest things lately, and they just crack me up! I just had to add them to my other cool collectibles, the "transforming" Mickey D's food toys...remember those? ...  ... I just wish they brought back the OG Apple Pie...I miss that deep fried goodness!!! ...  ... ALOHA!!!


Review 3: 2 stars bcuz I like McDonald's no matter what but dang-- fast food does not equal bad customer service. We ordered big so naturally, you would think a big bag would be in order but no. carrying the bag into the house, it ripped. I ordered the #11 (Fish Filet) and it never fails that the fish is never centered on the bun. We asked for sweet & sour sauce n grabbing it out of the bag, my girlfriend found it to be open already! ick! :( bad experiences = less customers. Make sure everything is in order before you leave.


Review 4: Normally I would not go to a fast food restaurant and I have different tastes however I decided to try McDonald's on Ann Road. The gentleman who took my order was very polite and got the order 100% correct. When I got to my worksite I had determined that the chicken nuggets that I ordered were cold. My work site with less than a quarter of a mile from this McDonald's and there is no reason for the nuggets to be that cold that quick. I did try several of them and all of them tasted as it had been sitting out for a while and were not fresh. I ended up throwing out all of the food that I lost my appetite due to the taste of the nugget. I am relatively sure that this is because it's the graveyard shift and is only two employees inside that McDonald's. I will not be going back to that Restaurants in the near future.


Review 5: This McDonalds is right next to my house, while I like the convenience, I have had numerous bad experiences with wait time during the late night drive thru only hours. This last time the guy in front of me waited  10+ minutes for whatever her ordered, then when I pulled up I had to wait 10+ minutes for my 2 Egg McMuffins. I knocked on the window and asked for a refund as I was tired of waiting, the girl who was doodling got rude with me and told me its late night and they just started there late night breakfast at 12am...It was 2am. Another girl heard the convo and brought over my "warm" egg McMuffins and I left. ...   ... This is actually the only place I have EVER written a corporation about for bad service.  I won't ever be going back there. Rather drive down to Jack n the Box on Craig. ...  ... To McDonalds credit, they called me and apologized and said they would look into it. So I shall just find other McDonalds to go to when in the mood.

Review 0: Don't be fooled.  The address isn't to the McDonald's in the photo.  This McDonalds is actually located in the Wal*Mart across the street. ...  ... They used to have workers there that were really unprofessional, but they shaped up their workers recently, I think.  The food is pretty good, can't complain.  Being in a Wal*Mart, they bring out the food pretty fast because it gets pretty busy at certain hours.  I do like this McDonald's and it's good because they're pretty much 24-hours.  Except for that one hour they close at 1am.  ^_^


Review 1: This location exclusively has 8pm-4am midnight snack of 6 piece nugget + small fries for $1.99!  ...  ... This location is inside the Walmart at Arroyo Crossing. It is probably very convenient and I always fall for the fact that it is in Walmart when I shop here. The staff are very nice and quick about taking the customer's orders and food are always pretty quick. There usually is a line of 1-2 when I visit but that could probably just be the time I get there. ...  ... I never had any 'problems' with the food that they 'served' me. ... I think the unique thing was the midnight snack advertisement they have. If you are here between 8PM - 4AM, they have a special of 6 piece chicken nugget + a small fry for 1.99 which is something I never seen advertised at other McDonald places.


Review 2: This McDonald's is located inside the Walmart at the Arroyo Crossing shopping center.  Since it's our local Walmart, we pass by this Mickey D's all the time.  More often than not, the Husband convinces me that he's hungry and wants to grab a snack while we're there.  Usually it's something easy like their Hot N Spicy Chicken Sandwich, but other times we've sat down for a full meal. ...  ... My most recent find discovery was during Halloween.  They were selling these Halloween Treat books for $1 each!  Inside were coupons for free apple dippers, free small cones, and free apple juice or milk jugs.  You get a total of 12 coupons for $1!  What a deal!  And what makes this location cooler than others is that they even offered it!  (I tried purchasing more at another location and they didn't offer it!) ...  ... Overall, they are pretty efficient and professional than some of the other McDonald's I've been to in Vegas.


Review 3: Very cool inside, Vegas' newest McDonald's with free WiFi like most other locations. What McDonald's has a chandelier? Cool blue, purple and black color palate used. The seating area inside of the restaurant has a newer designer. The giant Las Vegas Sign in the main sitting area with the rather larger TV is a nice touch. This location has a 24 hour drive-thru as of this review.


Review 4: Inside of Walmart so no drive thru. Gets crowded easily, especially with carts in the way. Sticky counters. You don't wanna bump into the trashcans cause they're covered in ketchup. Never have to wait long though and employees are usually pretty nice. Same stuff you'd get at any McD's.


Review 5: It was a McDonald's ... no just a McDonald's, but a McDonald's in a Walmart - it don't get better than this!   We had very good service. Food made "fresh" - but the people after us were ignored at the counter.  As for McDonald's, I think this one is not bad - just do not go and expect to feel good later.


Review 6: Ive been there several times and everytime it was fast service but the food was cold.

Review 0: This restaurant was clean and I loved the flowers placed on the tables.  It made it restaurant warm and inviting.  Our food (breakfast) came out fast and our order was correct..


Review 1: I hate McDonald's but my kids like a happy meal every once and awhile. this is a nice location since they redid the inside.


Review 2: This place is connected to a Chevron gas station and is open 24/7. The inside is sometime messy but, the staff that works the drive thru is usually always nice and gets your order correct the first time. I also like the fact that the drinks come in plastic cups and not the Styrofoam ones that some are using. The plastic one make the ice last longer and so the drink stays colder. This is an American staple and will always be back.


Review 3: I don't use the drive thru much but I was in a hurry to drop off my rental car and parking was non existent.  ...  ... My order a Angus burger combo and a apple pie. The burger was good, only exception there was excess mayo.. The fries were cooked perfectly - crisp and yummy. I've always been a fan of the apple pies at two for .99 or the same for one. Ended up getting only one. ...  ... Can't go wrong with McDonald's if you're in a hurry for fast food and they offer healthy options.


Review 4: The sliding door to the Vegas Summer heat was open & broken during my entire visit. The fries were sub par, but I powered through them because I was so hungry. I should have asked for new fries which has been a good idea in the past. ...  ... Did you know you can order fries sans salt? The chicken wrap was ok, but I've had better from other McD's before. ...  ... The staff was nice when taking my order.


Review 5: Typical. ...  ... Late night.....drive-thru kinda sucks!  You order at the first window (not through the speaker) but the window...so by the time you get to the second window ( if there aren't any cars in front of you) then you're just waiting for them to make your food. ... So you can be sitting there from 10 minutes (minimum) to about 20 minutes. ... Not really fast-food if you ask me but sometimes MCD's just fills the craving...especially after drunk and partying on the strip all night long and its time to just head back and unwind.!


Review 6: Stopped in for a quick bite to eat, as I was running very late to meet friends. I normally avoid places like this, but when you are in a hurry and your options are limited ya do what ya gotta do.  ...   ... The drive thru line was too long, so I went inside. I figured I'd get the two Cheeseburger deal, since they looked small and easy to eat while driving. The customer service was ok and the food came out pretty quick, almost too quick.  Place seemed clean. I don't really feel it's fair to remove stars based on me not liking fast food. This is definitely as good as I expected it to be, which isn't much. ...  ... The first issue that I thought was a little weird. While I was waiting for my food, a father and son came up to order more food. The father asked if she had a side of fruit for his son. She replied no. When she walked away I told him, that it looked like they had apple slices in the kids menu. When she came back he asked her and she said that they did have those. Last I checked apples slices were still fruit, but whatever. He asked how much and she said something like 50 cents or a dollar, then he asked how many came in that serving and she said 2. We both assumed she meant 2 slices... so he ordered like 3-4. When she gave him the 3-4 bags they easily had 4-6 slices in each bag. So I wasn't overly impressed with her knowledge of the menu, and felt that she didn't really seem to be invested in ensuring that she was giving out the correct information. This guy didn't really look like he was on a budget, but still he definitely didn't seem to need all of those apples for one small child.   ... My second issue is that I asked for my cheeseburgers without onions, and when I got in the car and opened up the wrapper, both burgers were covered in chopped onions that were basically impossible to easily remove. Boo!! ... I'm assuming I won't be back until the next time I'm desperate for a quick food fix.  Why can't Five Guys have a drive thru window... sad face.


Review 7: This place is disgustingly filled with flies everywhere! Not just a couple. Several hundreds of them. Some constantly buzz around you. And hundreds more just chilling on the ceiling.


Review 8: WORST McDonald's i've ever been to. they put my strawberry shake on the counter and didn't call me for it, even though i was sitting at the stool right by the counter.  they put whipped cream and a cherry on my shake without asking me, so they had to do it over.  ...  ... when i finally got it, my strawberry shake was barely pink in color with what looked like a squirt of vanilla shake on top of it. and as for the taste, there wasn't any. my first job was at McDonalds (one of the best jobs i'ver ever had). our shakes were dark pink and yummy - they didn't SUCK. ...  ... also, they had two managers back there talking about anything but running the restaurant. the floors were dirty and the clientele isn't the best. just another noisy, busy, gas-station stop, impersonal, hole-in-the-wall McDonald's. yuck. will never go back.


Review 9: Worst McDonalds!!!  ... After waiting at the drive thru for about 5 minutes I had ordered an iced coffee with cream only, when I got it I could tell the coffee wasn't fresh, it had a sour/ bitter taste. I went back through the drive thru, this time waiting about 10 min. to ask for a refund and the lady rudely told me "you said no sugar so of coarse it's going to taste bad!"  ... Really?!? No!! That's how I like my coffee!!  ... Way to start my morning! I will never go back to this location.

Review 0: Stopped in today for lunch to go. Requested a double fish filet, no bun and tartar sauce in a separate container.  ... They did a fantastic job. Fish was fresh and hot and I had plenty of tartar sauce to add to it.  ... Just the way I like it. Thank You !


Review 1: Egg nog shake.  This time of the year, that's a necessity in my book.  I stopped here today on my way home and got part of my annual intake of the precious, sweet, high calorie treat!  Ah, so good! ...  ... The staff was very pleasant and the process was quick.  I had a smile on my face as I drove the freeway home!


Review 2: sometimes I just want a sweet tea and 9000 chicken nuggets okay?! DONT JUDGE ME! haha but mcdonalds helps me quell my inner fast food junkie!


Review 3: I currently view McDonald's as more of a restaurant serving inexpensive snacks than meals. In my opinion, McDonald's is a level or few below the fast food powerhouses starring In N Out, Raising Cane's, and Panda Express. When dinner is far in the horizon and I want to calm my appetite, I order off the McDonald's $1 menu as I look forward to a better meal. The $1 menu features large fountain Coke beverages, a sausage buritto, a hot & spicy chicken sandwich, a double cheeseburger,  small coffee, and other foods. ...  ...    Both my check-ins here were when I hiked on the Angel Park Trail system. This McDonald's is convenient to the Angel Park Trail system; which includes the Bonanza Trail, Kellogg Sport's Complex, and Lone Mountain Trail. The restaurant is a convenient respite from outdoor activities. To reach this McDonald's from the Angel Park Trail system; from Bonanza Trail which is really the east spur of Angel Park Trail to you'd walk past the Kellogg Sport's Complex, walk under the Buffalo Drive tunnel and after the K-Mart turn left on Lone Mountain Trail. After Crossing Washington Avenue with a pedestrian signal, you'd turn left and McDonald's is on the right. ...  ...   As far as location,  I am curious why McDonald's passed over building the restaurant at the corner of Buffalo at Washington. The existing restaurant a few thousand feet east of Buffalo Drive on Washington Avenue is out of sight lines for motorists driving on Buffalo Drive one traffic signal north of Summerlin Parkway. Then again being McDonald's there is another location a couple of traffic lights north at Buffalo and Lake Mead Boulevard.   ...  ...   This is an older McDonald's. This is not surprising considering it is near Kmart. There is no theme. Just a basic McDonald's with a dining and indoor playground area. ...  ...   The two check-ins in this basic McDonald's were for a snack. On my first check-in,  I quaffed down the limited time Chocolate strawberry Frape. It was a yummy caffeine boost at a cost of $4 and 600-plus calories. Fortunately this was the halfway point of my hike and I'd burn some of it off. On my follow-up check-in,  I snacked on a Hot & Spicy Chicken with a large Coke. The Coke was flat. That is a no no! If the service wasn't decent and there wasn't a manager presence, this review would fall flat of 3 stars and sink to 2 stars.  ...  ...   I try to review places when I am a regular. Now that I am a Duke that will probably see that status fade at this location, it is time to emphasize that this is a decent restaurant for a snack or light meal off the Angel Park Trail system and in the vicinity of Washington at Buffalo.


Review 4: It's McDonald's. You get what you'd expect...consistently tasty, fast, low quality food.


Review 5: Stopped in for breakfast while attending the Best of the West Lacrosse tournament at Kellogg Zaher Sports Complex. This place was packed with lacrosse people from all over. The long lines inside almost made me turn around and go elsewhere. I'm glad we stayed. The staff behind the counter did a good job of getting through the rush in timely fashion. We were soon chowing down on our McGriddle and sausage burritos. The coffee was actually pretty good for fast food java as was the Chocolate Chip Frappe.  I would not hestitate to visit again, if I am in the area.


Review 6: I only expect a few things from McDonalds.. I mean.. it's McDonalds. I expect my food to be hot and the people to get my order right.  ... Not only did they not have Iced Latte's ready this morning, they also got my order wrong. The dollar menu hash browns include TWO, not ONE. But I guess that's a little difficult for the employees to understand, considering none of them appear to speak any english.


Review 7: I went to this McDonald's today to redeem a buy 1 get 1 free coupon for their new smoothie. I printed this coupon off from McDonalds.com. When I got to the window to pay, after a 5 minute delay, I was told my coupon would not be accepted since they don't accept corporate coupons. Pretty ridiculous when I get the coupon from their own web site. I hate McDonald's and this just furthers my hate for them. They did not get my business today and they will not get my business in the future. Thanks for SPECTACULAR customer service. What did I expect?


Review 8: Slowest service ever! And I don't have high expectations for mcdonalds but geez when there's a line with 15+ people you would expect they would put two people on register. They're so understaffed too! The cashier took an order and then went to prepare the food. AGH. ...  ... TLDR; The people here like to work in slow motion.


Review 9: Worst service EVER!!!!! Not only did they mess up my order but the manager was a jerk. He did not say sorry for messing up my order and gave me a dirty look. Ill NEVER go there again

Review 0: 12:30pm:  The woman who took my order was pleasant enough.  The manager-type who put out my order seemed harried.  Not sure who was responsible but I had to ask for my drinks.  It was the rush hour so I'll give them a break, although I did notice the pick-up counter was getting backed up with people waiting for corrections. ...  ... 2:00pm:  I ordered a sundae for me and a shake for my son.  The man who took my order was very pleasant.  Although  it was not busy at this point, the manager-type still seemed harried and flustered.  I saw her make the shake and then disappear.  The young man who brought out the sundae had to go looking for the shake and found it at the drive-thru window. ...  ... The good parts:  the Playland space was clean and the wifi worked.  Oh yeah, and it was cheap.  The ice cream was very good. ...  ... It just bums me out that I could have gone to In-N-Out, where they always get my order right and they are friendly and efficient.  If it wasn't for Playland, I wouldn't go here.


Review 1: Its a McDonalds, clean but staff is young and immature.


Review 2: Slow as a slug, and they usually eff up my order but its ok. ...  ... I continue to go here for sweet teas with lemon, and when I order food they usually forget something Im ok with that. This place has a horribly small through lane if you dont wanna go through th drive thru, SO BEWARE!! We also go here bc they have my sons Mcdonalds night so we go and eat out little ice cream with fries and enjoy the AC. ...  ... The drive through is SOOO SLOW and the workers are usually rude but what do you expect? They hate their job, but please dont forget my lemon in my sweet tea! ...  ... Cheap fatty food, but if youre in a semi rush or dont wanna cook go for it bro!


Review 3: Want a quick water cus its 108 outside? Sure. Tap water $1.00 didnt want to pay for tap water just a cup? .64 cents for a water cup.

Review 0: This place was convenient to me because I planned on doing a little grocery shopping afterwards and it's literally inside of the Walmart at Centennial Center. For a morning I'm usually used to McDonald's being unnecessarily busy, whether it's the drive through or in-store. I guess since this one is located in the Walmart it's not frequented as much as the other ones in town. I walked in and was able to order immediately. ...  ... I've been to countless McDonalds' where they pre-cook the sausage burritos and let them sit for hours, then the tortilla gets hard and it's just not enjoyable. Here, I forgot to ask them not to, but was VERY happy when we got the burritos and they were hot and fresh with soft tortillas. Everything else was pretty standard. I had a sausage egg & cheese mcmuffin that was surprisingly well assembled (but I'm sure this can vary by cook instead of store location) and a coffee that was made how I like it. ...  ... Everyone here was friendly and the dining area was spotless. There isn't much more you could ask for in a McDonalds.


Review 1: That's a sweet deal that McD is having Big Mac late-night for $1.00 starting from 8pm-4Am but too bad it's kind of out of my way to come & get it.


Review 2: Every time I come to this McDonald's it's so dirty. I know it's just a fast food restaurant inside Wal Mart, but it should be a little cleaner than this.

Review 0: Good service, food orders are always spot-on, and it's quick to boot.  For McDonald's, that seems to be extraordinary! ...  ... But seriously, their Drive-Thru is 24/7 and since it's down the street from my house that's fabulous if I come home in the wee hours.  Or, if I need to grab a quick bite before I drink spirits.  ;) ...  ... There's one guy there that's always extra-friendly and actually checks my ID -- on the back of my card it says "See ID."  A+ to you, dude. ...  ... P.S. Fries have always been crazy fresh (and we all know that's the best thing about McD's!)


Review 1: All I can say is this is the only McDonalds that charges you $1.20 for substituting sausage for bacon on the Big Breakfast. All they give you is one and a half slices!!


Review 2: Another national chain spot that has no reviews. And with good reason. It's pretty pointless to review a McDonald's. That is, unless you want the FTR! ...  ... McDonald's to me is good for one thing--their dollar menu. I'm a sucker for the $1 McDouble and maybe some fries. On road trips, the $1 one-price-fits-all-sizes fountain drink is priceless. Unfortunately, not all McDonald's locations stick to this pricing structure, but this location certainly does. ...  ... I've never actually been inside, but their drive-thru has the nice face-to-face three-window system. I'm not sure you need that third window just for ordering, but whatever. It works.


Review 3: I go here so much that I'm starting to never want to go again. It's the closest and cheapest food place to my house.  It's cheap which I love and it's pretty good. It's McDonald's nothing special. Just cheap decent food when I need it. It's really fast too.


Review 4: It's McDonalds, what else do you want to hear from me? ...  ... Oh yeah, this place has a face-to-face drive thru.  You don't speak to some crappy little speaker but to an actual person when you place your drive thru order.


Review 5: A Sausage McMuffin with Egg costs $2.79 yet they charge $3.33 for 2? What kind of DoucheTarded sense does that make? Not everyone can eat 2. I felt sorry for the elderly gentleman next to me that was had to buy a second one and give it away because McDonald moronic prixing. ... STAY AWAY FTOM MCDONALDS. I WILL NEVER GO TO ONE AGAIN!


Review 6: Another rippoff but then what are the options for breakfast at 4am. As much as they charge for a Bacon, Egg & Cheese Biscuit and 1 lityle 2-inch piece of Bacon. REALLY? This place sucks and I should have stsyed away.  ... Make sure to count your change too!


Review 7: I don't understand why an intelligent human being would go to this place and consume the stuff that this place sells. It is of less quality than the stuff they feed inmates at that tent prison in Arizona...literally. What McDonalds does is take some low quality beef, add soy and other mixtures for filler, and then flavor it with addictive chemical flavorings that they make in a lab. Look into it if you don't believe me.  ...  ... I cringe when my kids want to go there. It's so foul and not to mention freaking expensive. It's totally unbelievable to me that people eat there!


Review 8: While outside it is advertised as a 24 hour drive thru, I waited 15 minutes with no service.

Review 0: I NEVER eat McDonalds but on this one occasion I decided to stop and get an OJ and hash brown (9:00am).... I have never been treated better through a drive thru than I have this morning! The entire staff from the one taking my order to getting my order!! 4 stars cause let's face it, it's still McDonalds!!


Review 1: Ran through the drive thru today on the way to work for the much advertised "Egg White Delight McMuffin".  250 calories & 7 grams of fat! (versus the regular Egg McMuffin-300 calories and 12 grams of fat)  Oh hells yes!   I am a HUGE fan of the Egg McMuffin and was excited to try this one.  If only McDonalds would serve these breakfast sandwiches all the time and not just the morning my whole darn world would be brighter!  Sigh!  I think I need to start a petition! ...  ... Anyways, back to my sandwich.  The egg was fluffy, light and airy.  Totally not what I expected but hugely amazed at how good it was.  It wasn't dry like I had thought it would be.  The cheese was a white cheese versus the American cheese on the Egg McMuffin.  I didn't notice much different.  Overall the Egg White Delight is probably better than the Egg McMuffin.  Ooops shhhhh did I just say that?   ...  ... The service was alright.  Nothing too crazy but it WAS in the drive thru.  As long as everything comes out as ordered all is good right?  My only complaint which is always my complaint with Micky D's is they never put very much ice in their drinks.  Why is that?  SMH


Review 2: Swung by here on my way back to work. I wanted something fast and easy and fast is what I got. By the time I got to the second window my food was there. I got a double bacons cheeseburger which was pretty tasty and some french fries. The only down fall was that my food wasn't as hot as I would of liked. I think it was sitting under a heat lamp for some time.


Review 3: Different person working today. Still couldn't get the order right. STILL sucks. Still.


Review 4: Disgustingly filthy. Every table was dirty. I saw one food preparer sneeze into her hand, then continued to prepare food without washing her hands.


Review 5: I am giving this place 1 star for a very good reason.  I've been to this place twice now approx 2-3 weeks apart, on my way to work very early in the morning. Once inside, and once in the drive thru.  I think I had the same person take my order both times.  Well BOTH times my order was messed up.  How do you screw up breakfast????? ...  ... First time I was there I told him I wanted the new egg white mcmuffin with the white cheese ( I even POINTED to the huge pictures they have displayed on the wall)  and i want sausage.  When I opened it up, there was american cheese on it.   ...  ... When I went the 2nd time in the drive thru, I ordered a sausage egg biscuit and a sausage egg white muffin with the white cheese, and a hashbrown. I had a buy one get one coupon and my total was only $2.40 I knew right then he messed it up.  Sure enough, I pay and open my bag and there was canadian bacon on my sandwich instead of sausage and no egg on my sausage egg biscuit.   ...  ... Both times I was the only person there. I'd hate to see what kind of mistakes they make when their busy.   ...  ... GET YOUR ACT TOGETHER!!!! Making a breakfast sandwich isn't rocket science. !!!!


Review 6: I usually stop by here between the hours of 1am-3am due to my work schedule & the guy who I always see will not only take my order at the speaker, but will also repeat it to me at the window, but wrong so don't bother even ordering at the speaker.  Also they conveniently only take cash during the hours I visit. Pretty weird.


Review 7: This place still sucks. Ordered a double cheeseburger & got a single patty that was falling apart (picture uploaded) Yeah, still sucks.

Review 0: There is a lot to be said about this McDonald's. The chicken is great. I love the fresh fruit in the yogurt parfait and if you ever give me hot fries you will see me do my odd but strange happy dance. And this McDonald's has seen the dance of I'm so happy I just have no shame dance about a million times. Oh and the ice creme cones are only a dollar bill. Sure they are extra busy at this location but that's a Plus can u say hot and ready food.


Review 1: We just celebrated my sons 2nd birthday at this particular location and the party was AMAZING!!  ...  ... I know when you think of McDonald's, no big deal right? Well, this one is special! Since we have a very rambunctious 2 year old we have tested almost every McDonald's Playland in the city - this one passes the test with him! We were looking for a location to hold his 2nd birthday and we were running short on ideas since many of the things to do in Las Vegas/Henderson are geared toward older children. In my search for a birthday location I found this McDonalds on a website that lists all the great playgrounds/playlands in the city and it had many great reviews so I called to ask if they did birthday parties and unfortunately (at the time I called) they said that they did not. I was seriously bummed - and continued on with my search. One day we decided to take our son to this McDonalds just to burn some energy. I swear once we walked through the sliding glass doors and my son saw the playland, it was like the heavens opened up and his eyes got HUGE!! So much to do, so little time! This McDonalds was perfect for him, it is equally split between a toddler area (4 years and under) and their normal ginormous playland for older kids (4-99.) The playland is immaculate and obviously very well cared for. I decided to ask again if they hosted birthday parties and the manger said yes they did! I was ecstatic, we had found our perfect party location! It turns out they were doing birthdays and had stopped for a while and JUST started doing them again around my sons birthday...lucky us! All that was required of us at the time was a small deposit of $40 and a guesstimated count of how many children will be attending.  ...  ... The day of my sons birthday was flawless, not a hitch and and not an issue that might be expected of a fast food restaurant. I got to the location early to decorate and to my (totally pleasant) surprise it was already decorated and I had my own "hostess" to help me with whatever I needed help with. Our party had separate seating with balloons, party hats and a banner. Our hostess went around and took individual orders and took care of EVERYTHING which allowed me to really socialize with the parents and spend precious birthday time with my son. We had an equal amount of toddlers and older kids and they were equally having fun. After we all ate (the norm Micky D's selection of food) the hostess brought out a cake large enough for all of us and ice cream too. It was time for the bill and I was so surprised to find that I was only asked to pay for the individual meals we ordered and anything beyond that was just a part of having the party there. All in all it was a fabulous day, my son had a wonderful time and so did his guests. I am so glad I decided to ask if they did birthday parties again!!  ...  ... **On a side note, we took our son to this same location to meet Ronald McDonald a few weeks before his party and we were able to meet the franchise owner of this particular location. She was very hospitable and cared very much about the children there. It is very clear why this particular McDonalds is so well taken care of.


Review 2: I have passed through this restaurant over 10x on my way to appointments and I finally stopped to have a meal. The staff is very pleasant and friendly. The location is small and I feel they could utilize the space more effectively to seat more people. The restaurant has a children's play area which I think is great cause kids hate to wait. The food storage area is right near the children's play area so I don't think that's to safe. The tables are very nicely set and simple except very small so if yore ordering a lot you may find yourself crowded. Our food took half an hour to be served after ordering. I only seen 1chef on the griddle so that was the hold up.  ... The Crpe: we ha the Canada and Switzerland an it was so delicious. The expresso coffee was on point! I recommend everyone stop in and try it, it's worth the wait. The prices are reasonable and affordable. They make to go bags also!! I live in Blue Diamond NV so you know it's worth it if I drive that far on non appointment days. By the way upstairs of the restaurant has tons of Boutiques and shops. My personal favorite is BOX Human landscapers. Check them out !!


Review 3: Its McDonalds, what is there really to say!!  ... This location could potentially get 5 stars but its always always ... busy!!  ... Not sure how much of it is slowness behind the counter or just being  ... legitimately busy.  ... Either way, I live close so this is typically my mcdonalds of choice!


Review 4: Stopped in after a long day of work on St. Patricks Day and we originally were supposed to go to Mc Mullan's....Here's a breakdown in "Eat This, Not That format...... ...  ... Went Here                                          Not Here ...  ... Mc Donalds                                      McMullan's ...  ...  ... Ate This:                                           Not That: ... Filet O Fish and Fries                       Fish and Chips ...  ... 10 piece Chicken Mc Nuggets           Corned Beef ...  ... Blue POWERADE                            Green Beer ...  ... Shamrock Shake                             Sticky Toffee Pudding ...  ...  ...  ... ALOHA!!!!


Review 5: This location is a really nice McDs.  What a pleasant surprise! ...  ... I was in the area running some errands when my daughter wanted lunch.  I always cave in due to my ridiculous love of McNuggets, so we popped in for lunch.  The place was busy, but everything seemed to be flowing at a nice pace.  We didn't have to wait too long to order or for our food, which is always nice with a hungry toddler.  When we did get our food, it was piping hot and super yummy!  And I do know it is bad for me, but those gosh darn McNuggets, I tell you they have cast a spell on me! ...  ... Now the real reason we go to McDs is so my daughter can play and interact with other little ones since she is an only child...So I really gauge my writing on how nice the play area is at each McDs, in all honesty.   ...  ... First off, the play area was really clean.  I wasn't afraid to let my daughter go play.  I didn't feel the need to put her in a biohazard suit, so that is a big plus. This McDs has a huge play area with 2 sections for extra fun.  They have your regular climbing tubes and slides for your bigger kids.  If your toddlers are climbers, like my little monkey, they can handle these tubes fine as well.  The have a mini slide for extra little ones as well, which is nice because they don't have to be around all of the big kids, if they are on  the timid side.  They also had a whole separate climbing section that toddlers or big kids could play on.  It is nice for the kiddos to have so many play options.   ...  ... There was also a lot of seating, so we didn't have to fight for a seat.  It isn't fun to have to stand and wait for someone to leave just so you can sit down. ...  ... Overall, this is a nice fast food place.  Go check it out, if you need a quick bite to eat or have kids you need to wear out for their nap.


Review 6: This place is one of the better McDonald's I've been to. Service is good. No surprises with the food. Kids love the play place. Drive through can get really crazy! Lots of teens hang out here.


Review 7: I brought my son here to grab a quick bite to eat one very hot afternoon. It was nice that they have the air conditioned indoor play ground that seemed pretty clean. The food of course, isn't the healthiest but they do have better choices now. I got my son the apple slices instead of frys, and juice instead of soda. Of course he preferred to play then eat so he just ate when we got back home. ...  ... I had the honey mustard grilled chicken mini meal, which was just average.


Review 8: The drive thur here can be nuts depending on the time of day. Watch out for the jerks that think they can come in from the back side of the drive thru when it's busy too! And if you're one of the jerks that lets them in when people have been waiting in line, I will yell at you or flip my hands up at you, it's not a zipper people ( you know how a zipper works)  ...  ... The play area is a favorite for my kids.  ...  ... Here is the trick for super hot fries: Order them with no salt. This way they have to drop a whole new basket, because the other fries are all salted! Then you get the hottest fries ever! You can add the salt yourself!  ... Just don't do this in the drive thru because it holds up the line, and yes, you guessed it, I will yell at you!!!!


Review 9: I used to spend a lot of time eating drive thru. We are talking 3 times a day, 7 days a week. During that three years, I ate here at least 4 times a week, between breakfast, lunch and dinner. About 10 months ago I stopped eating fast-food all together, including McDonald's. At that time, the level of service that this particular McDonald's provided was on a slow decline. ... It started when I made the shift from double quarter pounders to grilled chicken salads. frequently, hell almost every time, I would not get utensils in my bag. So, I started asking at the speaker and at each window for utensils. Every time, I would get down the road, be rummaging through my bag, only to find that again I had no fork. ... My troubles did not stop there. Twice I got a salad, only to find that I could not eat it because the chicken was under cooked. If you know anything about working at McDonald's like I do (I worked my first job for 4 years at a McDonald's in KY), then you know it is hard to under cook grilled chicken. It is almost something you have to do deliberately. None the less, I am patient, so I did not complain. ... Periodically towards the end of my fast-food stent, the service level was going in the you know whatter. They had hired some 'new recruits' who were obviously to young and cool to care about the customers that they serve. I got full flavor of the chips on their shoulders every time i drove through. I knew that I was coming to the end of my fast food stage, so I just let it go and stopped eating fast food. ... Now, three days ago my brothers (who i live with), wanted to get McDonald's for dinner. I wound up getting it for them, though I was not getting any myself, cause I'm just that kinda guy. I go through drive thru, like always, and I can't believe it. Not only did I wait at the speaker for almost 3 minutes before anyone picked up, while there were no cars in front of me, but when I got around to pay, there was nobody at EITHER window. I waited, and waited, and waited some more. Finally after another 4 minutes, someone came to the second window scolding me for not stopping at the first window (which for the record I did stop for about 2 minutes). They were obviously having a bad day, and for whatever reason decided to take it out on yours truly. But that is not all. I finally get the food, make the short 2 minute trip home, get in the house, give my brothers the food, start telling them the horror story of our once favorite burger joint, and they stop me. They stop me to tell me that the food was so cold that they could not eat it. We wound up having spaghetti because it was just not eatable. Fail. ... I waited, hoping that I would just get over it, like I always to, but my voice has to be heard. This is simply outrageous. To think that in 10 short months, a restaurant can go from a family favorite to the worst place in the area is just unsatisfactory. Fail


Review 10: This McDonald's is in my neighborhood, so I wind up going there on a fairly regular basis to grab food for the family. It's usually busy, but my main issues have been with the drive-through service. Two out of the last three times I have gone through, I have had to go into the restaurant to get items that I had paid for but were omitted from my order. For some reason it usually seems to be a Happy Meal (which I order for my grandson). On one occasion they left it out but gave me the milk I ordered with it. The second time they gave me a small iced tea with it (which I didn't order), charged me $1.29 for the milk that was supposed to come with the Happy Meal at no cost, and left out the Happy Meal itself.


Review 11: Great job, guys.   You just lost a rave, 5 star review and a loyal customer. ...  ... My husband goes twice a week at least after working out to get a soda and a cup of water.  Cup of water is always free EVERYWHERE, until now...now you have to pay $1 for the cup (which is extra dumb, because a cup of soda there is $1...I guess soda's free and we're just paying for cups at McDonalds). ...  ... I'd understand if he just walked in and asked for free water, but he was a paying customer, and they know him there as he's a regular. ...  ... Also, very convenient that they suddenly start charging for tap water right when the hot summer weather hits.  Shameful.


Review 12: I used to love this McDonald's and it's actually a few cents cheaper then the one on cenntenial. After yesterday though I will no longer support this store.  ...  ... My wife stopped by hear yesterday to get myself and a few of my troops lunch then bring it out to us at work. Placing the order went fine and she got the food. Since it was a large order and she had to drive it out to us 20 minutes away she didn't stop to check it.  ...  ... When she delivered the food we found that a double quarter pounder was missing. No big deal I've been missing food from McDonald's before and gone back to get it. No not today when my wife gets to McDonald's and shows them the receipt and explains what happens they refuse to do anything about it. The manager tells my wife it's her fault for not checking the order for leaving. Isn't it your employees jobs to make sure the prder is completely filled out before you hand it to the customer?  ...  ... Now I'm out $5 because the manager refused to refund or give my wife another burger. Well we called the complaint line about it and complained thinking maybe we will be able to get them to send us a gift card for $5 or something, nope that's not happening either. So now we are out $5 for food we didn't even get. I know $5 isn't much but it's the fact that the store did nothing to right the wrong.


Review 13: Out of all carbonated drinks and it's not the firs time. And when I asked for a lemonade they wants to charge me extra. I told them that was not fair and over 59 cents they refused. Add to that they are always on a long wait and don't have a great track record for getting food orders correctly, why go there. I went at 7:30 on a Sunday  March 6th 2014 so hopefully someone reads this and has a talk with the brainiac manager working that doesn't realize all their customers r regulars and u should be better to them. I guess because the name is McDonalds they don't have to take care of us. Oh if u want to call because of anything including wrong orders, no answer.


Review 14: They just can't follow direction in getting an order right. If these kids are our future...we're in trouble.

Review 0: Not a lot I can say because I seriously visit McDonald's locations for one thing only: the Vanilla Reduced Fat Ice Cream Cone! It is very delicious, just one dollar (range between 99 cents to $1.29, not including sales tax), and just 170 calories! I cannot complain. We went through the Drive-Thru for our first visit and it went smoothly. Short wait with just 3-4 cars ahead of us. Clear speaker, the associate asked us to verify our order on the screen (great!), and there were separate windows for paying and receiving your food. Everyone was very cordial as well. I'll be back!


Review 1: Pretty new McDonald's, used to be a KFC. It's nicely renovated and designed but tables are often not wiped and cleaned and last time I was there, they had no more ketchup next to the soda. This place is run by mostly by teenagers. Menu is displayed on techy monitors which I love. Management could be better. Room for improvement. Nothing amazing but not bad.


Review 2: Knowing how bad the drive through service has been I went inside and placed an order for a burger. The lobby wasn't trashed but in a need of a sweep and a wipe down.  ...  ... I ordered my Habanero Quarter Pounder and sat at one of the only clean tables in the store. The register guy did come out to sweep and while he did try his best I have to wonder why he choose to move the chairs at my table and sweep below my feet (remember that it was the only clean table in the store) and ignore what I'm only guessing was a hunk of apple on the floor at the table across from me or the fry and salt residue on the seats of the same table? He even went so far as to pick up a stack of napkins from the floor and put them onto the table top.  ...  ... I know I know young kid working his first job trying so hard but he/they desperately need to go back to the McDonald University and get some remedial training or this store is going to fail to earn repeat business from its locals.


Review 3: By far the WORST McDonald's I've ever been to!!!  If I could give it less then one star I would.  I live right down the street so this is the easiest McDonald's to get to, but ever time I go the wait is ridiculous, the serve is horrible, and the food is thrown together!  I suggest everybody go to the McDonald's off rainbow instead because it going to take just as long either way.   And their staff is a lot more friendly!!


Review 4: Do I have to give them 1 star you all should consider this a negative star.Absolutely the worst fast food service I've ever experienced.Every order I've gotten has been in some way or the other wrong.i check every order but I'm not opening boxes n unwrapping sandwiches.Today I ordered an egg n cheese Mc muffin got em home n they put ham on em.the worst one was couple of months back they had those wings n I ordered them n sat at window for 7 min been in line for 10 then Mgr asks me to pull up to wait in s designated space .I'm just sitting there before I realize I've been there another 10 min and there are no cars in line. I drove over to front door went in an there's the Mgr sitting at a dinning room table eating.i asked her where my food was that I've been waiting for 15 minutes outside.i was so mad I just took my food n left.2 months later stupid me went back for another screw up.Buy the way this Mgr is on duty 90 percent of time I go there.I was a Mgr for 20 years in fast food n sit down I wouldn't hire this lady as a cashier


Review 5: I was so excited for this McDonalds to open, it's about time we get a food place in that location. So you can imagine my disappointment with their terrible service and bad quality food making!! ...  ...  Worst. Worst. Worst. I get they are new. I do, so the first few times I went, I kept my cool, didn't complain, smiled, etc.  ...  ... I like to go mid-morning on my way to work for either just coffee and a Sausage McMuffin with no egg... How complicated of an order can it be??!! Sometimes I will mix it up and get a combo meal, this is usually where they royally screw it up.  ...  ... I'm irritated just thinking about the visits Ive had and how 4 out of 5 visits they screwed something up.  ...  ... To make this brief, here are my major issues.  ...  ... I order Splenda to be added to my drink. I'm in my work clothes, and I don't want to pull over and carefully add it myself and spill on my clothes since they A) they always fill it too high, and B) I don't want to make any more stops!  ...  ... Cheese: hardly ever melted on the Quarter Pounder, or Big Mac and I've tried about 3 or 4 times. Cheese not melted, or the tiniest blob of sauce! I wanted the new habanero ranch, couldn't even taste the sauce except for one bite! Plus it was luke-warm at least twice! The hot & spicy with a tiny splash of mayo? I mean, really!  ...  ... I ordered an iced Caramel Mocha, get to the window, she hands me the latte, it had no caramel on the whip, so I ask, is this the Caramel Mocha? She stares at me blankly and says yes, I say, I'm used to it having caramel on top, she says its a caramel mocha, so off to work I go, I'm already late because they are super SLOW, and sure enough take a sip after I'm gone and it's a regular mocha. Pathetic service! ...  ... I did write in to corporate after my 8th or 10th attempt to do business there.. And the manager called me and apologized. Told me to come in and get a free combo on him. So not happening. Go in so they can remember me as the Girl who called them out for their shit slow service, always messing up my orders,  and crap food making? No thanks. I would have rather had some coups sent so I could remain anonymous.  ...  ... Oh well. I just drive a few more blocks down to Rainbow and Blue Diamond location if i have the extra time, they are great!  ...  ... As for this place? Shame on you for STILL not being able to get your shit together!  ...  ... One positive note I will say is there are two very friendly employees there. They work the drive thru taking orders/$$ I wish I had their names!  ...  ... Will I be back? Sadly probably yes, it's very convenient for me on my way to work when I don't have time to go to rainbow location.. But I limit what I get, try to keep it simple and always hope for the best... Maybe someday they will be a great location... As for now? The McDonald's Corporation would be ashamed!!!


Review 6: ok so yes they are new and yes it looks nice inside,but every time i go there my food is always i mean always wrong,and to make it ever worse is when you ask them to fix it and they still get it wrong, Thats pretty bad. And there are a few mangers there that just need to quit or be fired,they are rude ,they interrupt you when your tring to explain what was wrong.How does a sausage egg mcmuffin with no cheese turn into a ham egg and cheese biscut.


Review 7: This is got to be one of the worse McDonald's ever, even surpassing the McDonalds In Hawthorn Nevada! ...  ... Stopped there two times in two days, I was sick and didn't want to cook or get out of the car. Plus, as a child when I got sick my mother would buy me a Big Mac. ...  ... Anyway, we stopped and went thru the drive thru, it was pretty quick both times. Our larger truck fit through, so that is a good thing. ...  ... The first trip, my husband, also sick, drove off as soon as the food was handed to us. I'm all like what are doing? I haven't tried the fries yet! Anyway, the fries were either over cooked,( I don't think so), or cooked twice. The amount of salt was unreal and the fries were cooked beyond crispy. ...  ... Second trip, the fries looked like McDonalds fries just not very warm, and yes he drove off before I tried one. We get back to the R.V. resort we're staying at and I try my Big Mac, almost no sauce and very bland. The patties also look like they have gotten smaller. ...  ... The two ladies at the window were not overly friendly but not rude either. If you want a burger just stop at In and Out across the street.

Review 0: Heading home, I made a quick stop here to pick up a McFlurry for dessert.  Service was prompt, the restaurant was clean, and about the only thing to diminish my enjoyment of the McFlurry was the woman talking on her cell phone at about 120 decibels.  After a few strategic glares from me, she took it outside. ...  ... I generally don't stop at thisMcDonald's, but given the circumstances and the fact I was heading home, it made a good place to get dessert! ...  ... And, there's free wifi.


Review 1: I watched this place as well as everything along durango by the park go up. i remember when it used to be a dirt lot.  ...  ... Great location. SUPER convenient when need a fast and quick bite. Chevron is right there attached as well.  ...  ... Out of the many years its been open, i've only had 1 issue and it was so long ago, i dont remember what happened. I just remember they gave me more food as an apology.. Haha.  ...  ... Drive thru usually pretty fast.


Review 2: Every time I go to this McDonald's I order my food, they give it to me, and then I eat it.


Review 3: The employees here totally love their jobs; I can tell. They are just so enthusiastic about working at McDonalds and they just can't contain it. If they were in a Disney movie, there would be one heck of a musical number about it. ...  ... Alright, not really. But they work at McDonalds. Can you really blame them for being blas about it? ...  ... The wait in the drive thru is almost always pretty long. The food is standard McDonalds food. I haven't had any issues with my order being incorrect.


Review 4: There's always a line when I go to this McDonalds. I usually go through drive-thru and service is normal, but wait time is LONG. I come here when I'm desperate and don't' know what else to eat.


Review 5: So when I checked in here, there was a wait at the drive thru and I was looking over reviews and I couldn't imagine a McDonald's being THAT bad. Well.. It was. No pickles on my burger, my drink had no ice and wasn't full, and the fries were lukewarm at best. Next time I'll be headed to the location on buffalo and flamingo.


Review 6: They are getting better instead of everytime messing my order its almost everytime I go inside everytime now because if you go through the drive through theywil mess your order up....this lady a few days ago was so confident she got my order right she watched me go through my bag (like i did somethin wrong) and praised herself on gettin the order right but  YOU DIDNT!!! my onions were still wrong after "ya ya i got this" but you didnt cuz you were to busy with something else and not listening....I really believe everyone in this location severly puffs the ganga b4 work  cuz they can never get it! Not that i blame them BUT i still pay for it so GET IT TOGETHER!!!!


Review 7: Came here with my husband and my daughter. While giving my order (with my family next to me), the MANAGER named Ricardo, kept WINKING at me. Yes, the manager. Not once but many times.  ...  ... it took everything in me to calm my husband down and not let him deck the guy. I told my husband that I would report it.  ...  ... Getting home, I called and reported the situation to corporate. they said I would receive a call from someone immediately. ...  ... Tori, the district manager called me the next day and gave me the lamest excuse Ive ever heard. Her exact words were, "Well, he does that to everyone, its just who he is. I mean, he even winks at me all the time and I'm not eve a pretty woman." Um, okay?! How does this make it right. i was furious and told her so. She continued to defend his actions saying he does it all the time. Excuse me, but I was a manager at a restaurant once upon a time and 1. winking is considered sexual harassment. 2. Its not appropriate for him to do that to a customer and definitely not his boss, the district manager. If he is allowed to do that and get a way with it, I can't imagine what he does to the female workers under him. ...  ... Called corporate again and yet, again nothing done. Not even an apology. ...  ... Used to come here all the time for a happy meal for my little girl but now i will NEVER come back to this mcdonalds and maybe never give another mcdonalds a chance. This situation made me sick and uncomfortable.


Review 8: I don't like giving bad reviews, but this is the WORST McDonalds EVER. This isn't a one time thing either, constant mistakes, wrong orders (and I'm not altering my order in any way)...seriously? How hard is it to just get it right?!!!


Review 9: I went into this Mc Donalds bec there was 12 cars in the drive thru and when I got inside.. it was complete chaos !! It took 4 people to fig out how to work the register, while the fry machine was beeping beeping beeping .... One girl was texting on her cell phone and with 5 people in line, the young inexperienced manager went and sat down in the rest. and got on phone.  They were rude and it was unacceptable !! Horrible service and products !!


Review 10: Pulled in. Said my order. The guy completely butchered it and treated me like I was a stupid idiot for ordering an iced latte! Screen showed wrong so I tried to correct him. No answer for a solid 4 min of sitting there. Then he rudely says are you going to pull up? From there... Didn't charge the right amount and was more concerned with talking about a party with this guy behind him. From there... I pull up (wrong order).... Ask for what I ordered and got the wrong thing again. Props to the girl at the second window apologizing and so on but still c'mon 1 freAking iced latte!!!


Review 11: These people want us to raise min wage to 15 an hour when they can't get a simple order right and then argue about it ? You can't even do the basic essentials of a simple task. You put in the order and give the customer what they paid for. Not argue with them. This is why they won't raise your pay because you can't do your job right. You get paid what you put in.

Review 0: I know I'm going to lose any credibility I've built for this review but I don't care. Why a 5 stars?  Because I can't give six stars for my beloved 99c soft serve ice cream. It's the best desert I can think of after any meal. If I could purchase their machine and recipe for the ice cream, It would be sitting in my kitchen this minute.  ...  ... 99c for 99 calories of perfect treat. I know there are tons of soft serve ice cream out there but Micky D makes it just right to my taste. Packed at least 6 inches high on a tiny cone. It's not to watery, not too creamy. Not too soft and not too hard. Not too sweet. It takes me 10 minutes to get through the whole cone and I do savor those 10 minutes. How many deserts can you think of that takes more than 3 minutes to devour. Pies, cakes, puddings, cookies nope! Ah..If only I can have a cone now... ...  ... (Note: That's why I befriended Mike P. He's standing next to my perfect desert ) ... http://www.yelp.com/user_photos?userid=jo8vV5iUZLHp617cTKZ7mA&select=DVKynf25Qs0KCXhXbtPrDw&return_url=/user_details%3Fuserid%3Djo8vV5iUZLHp617cTKZ7mA


Review 1: This place is crazy busy .. I guess bec of the location and they have that kid playland thing.


Review 2: I work in this area, and so sometimes I'll stop by here to get food when I haven't brought anything from home. Gotta say, they have gotten a lot of new staff and it's really nice now! Clean, fast, and satisfying. ...  ... I usually do large orders because I order for myself and some of my co-workers. The employees are patient and usually try to tweek my order so that I can get the best price for my food. Everyone's pretty nice, too. ...  ... Their drive-thru is really busy around noon, and totally not worth using. But in the mornings and late at night, it's super fast and no one has ever forgotten my straws, napkins, or ketchup. ...  ... I'm lovin' it!


Review 3: Love McDonalds to the end. ... Review based on location. ...  ... Star 1: Right inside the Boca Park plaza. Hungry after window shopping or messin around at Guitar Center? Come on down! ...  ... Star 2: The parking lot is spaciously awesome, and the location feels safe. ...  ... Star 3: The seating is roomy. Had a party of 9 for a meeting. It's pretty chill on Monday nights. ...  ... Star 4: It's McDonalds man. Who can beat the dollar menu?! ...  ... I love it when the fries are still hot when you eat 'em.. They weren't this time..


Review 4: I stopped in to pick up a side salad to take home rather than make a salad from scratch.  The line at the drive through went very slowly.  I should have parked and walked in. ...  ... The salad was fresh and with my own dressing it made a great addition to my meal. ...  ... The only problem I have with this McDonald's is the ease of getting in and out.  It isn't easy.  because of the way it sits in Boca Park, the drive through is in the back and you need to watch traffic going to other stores in the next section.  It's not the most easy space.


Review 5: It is scary when they know what you're going to order as soon as you walk in? Yes, I've been here more than a few times


Review 6: It's a McDonalds, not good, not bad. Playplace was clean, and the people were nice. ... I iwsh I could say more about it but nothing stands out, just food, typical temp, typical employees.


Review 7: It's McDonalds. Cheap, quick breakfast. That's about its use. They have free wifi if you like this place.


Review 8: McDonald's is my go to breakfast joint when I go golfing in the morning.  I grab a couple of Sausage McMuffin's with Cheese so I can fill up before a round of golf.  Since I was golfing at the Badland's Golf Course nearby, I dropped by this location.  I went through the drive thru and it was very fast and efficient and they got my order correct. ...  ... Overall, A-OK for a fast food joint. ...  ... Return Factor - 50%


Review 9: Disappointed. Again, another Summerlin McD's just doesn't cut it. The burgers were tasty (and at least not dry) but not hot. They were just a bit over room temperature. Granted, business was slow when we arrived, with only two other guests. Not sure if we will come back here again. If we do, maybe we should take our food home and microwave it just a bit. Ugh.


Review 10: exactly what the stars say. MEH. i realize that it is just mcdonalds, but i have definitely experienced better. everytime i come through here the employees are very monotonous and the fries are cold. seriously, the fries are the best part of mcdonalds; the least you could do is give me a decent order of hot, salty deliciousness!


Review 11: I payed a visit to this location's drive thru today and really wasn't impressed. ...  ... When I arrived at the window to pay for the order I placed the guy opened the window and just stared at me. I had to ask him how much I owed so that I could pay for my order. I guess he just assumed I could understand anything he might have uttered through their high quality drive thru speakers. ...  ... The drive through service was extremely slow. This is one of those places that make you wish you would have parked and walked in because you probably would have gotten your food faster. ...  ... The food was typical McDonalds...nothing special.


Review 12: It was ok.  It was dirty, and the staff was kind of rude.  Other than that, it was ok.  lol


Review 13: When all you have to do is select an icon to complete a patrons order one should expect that service would be good.  Somehow they never seem to get it right.


Review 14: For some reason everything time I come through the drive threw, they are slow and rude. Wonder what's happening inside smh


Review 15: If I could give zero stars I would!  ... this is the worst location for McDonald's ever! they never get the orders right


Review 16: Rude, sloow crew. You would think that when the place is empty you could run in and out. Instead employees ignore you, even if you ask for service directly. Stay away.

Review 0: Drive-thru is always fast. ...  ... I don't like going inside, though. Inside has a very different atmosphere. The staff there seems less interested in customer service. But the drive thru team is stellar.


Review 1: They know what they are doing at this restaurant. Occasional mistakes but I freakin love McDonald's.


Review 2: This one was attached to the gas station here at my corner and I've never been inside, and even though I like McDonalds. I rarely eat here except for bkfst once a week, on my way to work.  But I had to stop in and get my filling of McRib (YEA BABY) :-)  When I walked inside, it was actually VERY nice looking.  It didn't look like the typical McDonalds dining room.  It had beautiful cushion benches/booths and it was quiet too. You would've thought you were in a nice coffee house.   ...  ... The price for my McRib was $1.99 each (which seemed like a fair price) I had that and a medium fry and an order of chocolate chip cookies (I love their cookies).   ...  ... I got home, the sandwiches were hot and yummmmmmmmyyy. Fries were just ok, and the cookies were really good too.   ...  ... If I just wanted to get out sometime and go for a coffee or a small treat or bkfst. I would definitely go and relax in their dining room.


Review 3: Drive through is pretty fast.  ... I came with my friends, just wanting a few sodas. Drove up, ordered 2 diet pepsis and an unsweetened ice tea with extra ice. They didn't repeat the order, so I was kinda unsure if they got my order right. Sure enough, they gave me a sweetened tea (lacking ice). Of course I didn't notice until we had left the area so, there was no point in going back. Kinda disappointed that they can't get an order of 3 soft drinks correct.


Review 4: I actually visited the McDonads inside the Walmart across the street from this place. I couldn't check in because it was attached to the Walmart..? ...  ... Anyway, Walmart McDonalds are the stingiest. Extra price for everything. ...  ... They have this cool deal though. 20 nuggets, 2 large fries, 2 large drinks for $10. Not bad if you're in the mood for nuggets. ...  ... Other than that, go to a different Mickey D's.


Review 5: I would always pay a visit to this place for their Holiday Pies ... Oh and honeslty i would have ordered a happy meal for myself just cause their giving out Hello Kitty watches which unfortunately they happen to run out. Boo!!!


Review 6: This McDonald's puts real flowers on the tables. ...  ... WTF. ...  ... AND, it's a gas station McDonald's.  It's not even a free-standing McDonald's. Mind=boggled. ...  ... Anyways...I never eat at McDonald's but had a hankerin' one morning for hot cakes.  I was a little perplexed walking in, however, because the decor was really modern and...tasteful.  Not what you expect from a McDonald's.  A+ franchisee, A+. ...  ... Also, I learned a great thing, the greatest thing I learned in all of August 2012.  McDonald's now serves dipped cones! And, they're good.  Screw off DQ, I'm going to fancy McDonald's from now on!


Review 7: This place absolutely sucks. Every time I come here, Every Time, they screw up my order. My worst experience here was when I stopped by for a late night snack and they forgot an order of nuggets that they charged me for. i drive back around and they just closed and wouldn't even open the window to listen to me. I understand its a safety thing but they still took my money and didn't give me my food. Management was apologetic but never offered me either my money back or to give me my food. I was over it and didn't want to waste anymore time on this place.

Review 0: This is probably the best customer service I've gotten at a McDonald's ever in my life. Their cashier Felecia was so nice that it caught me off guard. Of course it's just your regular McD's but with fast & friendly service!


Review 1: This McDonald's is located in the Midway section of Circus Circus where the circus acts are performed and kids games played. ...  ... I believe the prices are the same as regular McDonald's locations.  They are not priced higher just because they are located inside a Hotel Casino in Vegas.  So that's a good thing. ...  ... There are plenty of tables for seating.  Nice spot to getaway from some of the craziness in the casino and/or children's games.


Review 2: HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE SERVICE!!! They gave me half my order and told me I would be called again when the rest of my order was ready.  Well I was never called so when I went up to the counter to inquire about my order, the employee was very rude and claimed I was called several times which is a lie because I was waiting at the counter. I had to go back to the counter when I realized those idiots forgot to give me my drink cups and I was scolded that I should've asked for my drink cups when I picked up my food. As I was walking away they were loudly talking $ht about me. UNBELIEVABLE!

Review 0: I would never usually review a McDonalds, but here's why this place rules: ... 1) $5 for a 20 pack of Chicken McNuggets at 3am. When everything else in the food court was closed, we had this trusty option which ended up being our "go to". I couldn't imagine how extra hungover I would've been each morning without this grease. ... 2) An alternative to overpriced breakfast at the buffet at the hotel. ... 3) A quick way of grabbing something for less than $5 when not needing a full meal during the day. ...  ... 5 stars for that!


Review 1: I needed a quick breakfast before catching my flight back to new york. This McDonalds was located inside my hotel in the food court section. I ordered my orange juice, sausage biscuit, some pancakes and on my way I went.  It was a bit of a wait but my order was complete and the food was ok.


Review 2: No Hot Mustard :(


Review 3: The McDonald's chronicles. ... Hooray for free refills. ... I just want a bite to eat, make my daughter happy. not spend a lot of money, and drink as much soda as I can quenching my thirst is the dry air.  The McDonald's doesn't charge that much of a premium.  The place is clean and is a good, affordable rest before putting the feet down back on the strip's concrete.


Review 4: This McD's wasn't too bad. Not too busy when we went to grab some late breakfast. You can't beat the dollar menu either. $1 salad from there is nutritionally equivalent to eating something from Quiznos (which my friend had in the food court and hated) at a fraction of the price.


Review 5: I work in the area and have eaten here several times. I can attest to the fact that this is one of the worst McDonalds to eat at. ...  ... You can at least be sure of consistent service. Consistently lousy. Consistently noisy and consistently dirty. ...  ... Only eat here as a last resort


Review 6: The oatmeal was good. The fruit was crisp and the raisins plump. The sweet tea was fresh.


Review 7: This McDonald's is located inside the Excalibur hotel and was one of the worst experiences I've ever had at a Mickey D's. We wanted a quick breakfast at around 9:30 a.m., so my friend decided to grab some for us to bring back to the room before heading out for the day. He ended up waiting over 30 minutes in line to get 2 egg Mcmuffins and coffee, and I had to wander out of the room to see what the hold up was. There was also no dollar menu available when we were there, so we ended up paying the $3 for a greasy sandwich. By the time we got the food back to the room it was cold, but at least the coffee stayed warm.


Review 8: Horrible service!! Not friendly at all. I asked for a couple of sauces, they told me I would have to pay 52 cents! What happened to customer service? Worst mcdonalds I have been too. Cheesy move on their part. Giving them one star is being generous


Review 9: Just an unpleasant experience. I live here in Las Vegas and will often take family to the Strip when they come to town. We were looking for a late night bite to eat and decided on McDonald's since it was right in the hotel. The servers were incredibly rude. My aunt had only asked if they were serving smoothies and the girl behind the register rolled her eyes and responded with an attitude. After receiving our food, I had asked another employee where I could find straws. She intentionally ignored me upon my first attempt to get her attention. When she finally turned around after talking to her friend, she acted as if I was burdening her. ...  ... Maybe I'm expecting too much from a fast food place on the Strip, but I feel that if you are working in customer service, you should be providing customer service, not acting as if you are still in high school and hanging onto that angsty teenager we all have inside us.


Review 10: On Christ almighty here it goes. If I am going to eat overpriced McDonalds in a casino I better get what the hell I want to eat. This place is so pitiful just thinking about it makes me angry. I don't even know where to start! Besides Starbucks and Krispy Kreme this is your only option for late night eats at The Excalibur. Here it goes: ...  ... Visit #1: Fool me once...shame on you. ... My husband and I head to the room early our first night in Vegas because we were tired after a long drive. After watching some TV my husband said he wanted a little something from our local McDonalds. I was not really hungry but I was craving a little something sweet so I asked him to get me a McFlurry and to call me and tell me what kind they have. He calls and they have Oreo, M&M, and Butterfinger. YUM! I want Butterfinger I exclaimed! He hangs up and calls back about a minute later to break the news to me that they are out of Butterfinger. That would've been useful info to have when he first asked! So I ended up with Oreo. He comes back and I take a bite of my McFlurry. For those who may not know a McFlurry is soft serve icecream mixed with whatever topping you get. How do you possibly mess that up? Messing up a McFlurry is equal to the stupidity of burning cornflakes! There is no excuse. I took one bite and threw it away. The icecream was warm and the oreo chucks were stale. NASTY! My husband's burger and fries turned out ok at least.  ...  ... Visit #2: Fool me twice....shame on me.  ... After some late night gambling I was hungry and did not feel like searching for late night eats so I ventured into this hell hole again. I figured since I was getting regular food this time it would be ok. The customer service of this place is atrocious. You are pretty much the only 24 hour operation that offers more than donuts and coffee so change your attitude. My husband had a sweet tooth this time and wanted a McFlurry. Dun Dun Dun! I order my food and ask for a Oreo McFlurry and the guy behind the counter proceeds to tell me that the icecream machine is locked. Excuse me? WTF? I call my hubby and tell him and he is most displeased. After two minutes of straight  cursing he asks for chocolate chip cookies, they have none. The only had oatmeal raisin which I can only describe is the asshole of cookies. So literally they have no good desserts. So my poor baby goes without what he wants. We are not doughnut fans so Krispy Kreme is not really appealing. After that I was done with that place for good! ...  ... If you are ok with McDonalds go to the one at The Luxor. You will probably get better service. We should've.  If you want something better venture into NYNY into America cafe which is open 24 hours and for the same price you can get some decent food and service.


Review 11: This is a lousy McDonalds. So slow. So surly. Once you finally get the food it doesn't even seem to matter anymore.


Review 12: This is by far the worst service I have ever had in any fast food restaurant. ...  ... Now I understand that working fast food isn't easy, but having a burger tossed at me was the end of the line. Enough said, so upset that I tossed right back at the rude ass lady behind the counter. If you can wait a couple more feet, there are way more options than this pile of dump. The only thing worse than having to walk through the Excalibur, is walking by that stink hole.


Review 13: This place is a joke! It's disgusting enough of a fact that the only thing to eat at Excalibur between the hours of 0200 and 0600 is McDonald's, Starbucks, and Krispy Kreme. But then, to be forced to go to McDonald's and find this pitiful excuse of an establishment instead.... for shame. The first night they ran out of Butterfinger topping for a McFlurry. The second night, they claimed their ice cream machine was "locked." Not broken.... but locked. WTF is that?!?! If you are the only late night eatery available, you better have all your menu items available because I have a bit of a sweet tooth. This place is a joke... do yourself a favor and walk across the footbridge to New York New York and eat at America, their late night cafe.

Review 1: Las Vegas,. the only place with Spicy McChicken,.. my friends kept raving about how good the Spicy McChicken was; after a night of drinking throughout our whole trip,....  ...  ... I just had to run to MCD before we caught the shuttle to the airport and ordered one before we caught our flight home,..  ...  ... They were right,.. ...  ... Spiceyyy ahhhhh


Review 2: Open after midnight on New Years, how awesome. All I really remember is the guy with the electronic pad to place orders, kind of like the in n out ones and picking up our fries and cheeseburgers and eating them upstairs in bed a few minutes later. YAY!


Review 3: This location is open 24 hours a day in the food court of the Monte Carlo. ...  ... Lines do not get too long and service is great. ...  ... It's the best feeling to walk back into the casino, partially inebriated, and just grab a burger and go up to my room.


Review 4: Staff is very friendly, the place is clean, and the food is warm. What more can you ask for from a fast food restaurant?


Review 5: This is a very busy Strip McDonald's in a food court. The prices are inflated. As far as service, it is okay. To be fair, if I were to rate the physical place I'd have to rate the Monte Carlo Food Court.


Review 6: (This is the McD's inside the Monte Carlo food court) ...  ... This place gave me and 3 of my friends food poisoning!  After losing alot of money at roulette, I wanted to comfort myself with some good ol' fashioned greasy food from my childhood.  ...  ... BAD IDEA.  7 people sharing one bathroom, 4 of them sick.  DO NOT EAT HERE!!

Review 1: The only reason I come here every now and then, is because it's close to our home. Otherwise, this place is known to mess up your drive-thru order.


Review 2: 0 stars bad customer service.. didnt like gms attitude.. very rude. And no outlets to.charge phones..

Review 0: Normally I wouldn't bother with a fast food joint, but every time I come here my orders are consistently messed up. No matter what day, what time of day or how simple my order is something is always wrong. Today my iced coffee didn't have ice in it. Another time I had to remind them for my change. Always a fail.


Review 1: Seriously I do not know why I bother with this place other than it's the closest fast food to where I live.  So many fails it's unbelievable.  Burgers with no buns, wrong orders, soda without carbonation or taste.  I've even gone far enough to complain to corporate.  Even though they had someone call me about it they actual place didn't seem to improve.   Just skip it.


Review 2: Starts as good still serving breakfast I'm happy ok. Then the McCafe machine is broke ok screw it I'll just by Starbucks. Next order taken employees shift change and forget to make my food. All I can say is are you kidding me


Review 3: they mess up every time i go unless my order is under 3 bucks, even if its just sweet tea, its straight crappy water.  i called corporate twice, they sent me a coupon which was not even the value of what they made a mistake on.  my name was in the BOOK and the lady behind the counter still wanted my receipt. corporate even said i didnt need one. i understand they get jacked all the time, but dont jack your customers....its a pass


Review 4: Went there on a Sunday afternoon.  It was only moderately busy. But only one cashier (Jessica Carter) taking orders. She complained that kids in general in restaurant were screaming too loud and that she was too busy to accurately take our orders. Waited more than 20 minutes for our food. The order as placed on tray was incorrect.  A new low in fast food...

Review 0: Paige is an awesome employee! She is able to multi-task always with a smile! How refreshing for fast food!


Review 1: Great service at the drive-thru.  Could be a bit cleaner on the inside.


Review 2: I know... It's horrible that I feed my child these greasy, non-nutritional meals but you know what, there are days that I'm desperate. Call me a bad mom... Go ahead, I dare you!  ...  ... Anyway, sometimes it needs to be done. In any case, I don't have any problems whenever I come to this one. I go through the drive-thru, pay, pick up my order and roll out. My stuff is always in the bag and I've got a happy kid.


Review 3: Why is it when your Order is wrong they Act surprised like this has never happen before. Do yourself a walk in.


Review 4: They only accept cash? Since when? Food was cold. Its Mc Donald's I guess that's expected? Oh and the cashier can't count. She short changed me. I think I'll call corporate. Worst Mc Donald's ever.

Review 0: Agree, worst McDonalds ever. Not only did they mess up our order, they messed up the order before ours.


Review 1: Horrible Service- to the extent that I had to come on and write about a mcdonalds... Lol


Review 2: Worst McDonalds in Vegas! Bad service consistently and sloppy made food. 3 trys and still crap. WTF! I am sure the hobo's panhandling outside could do better. They seriously must go out of the way to fuck things up. I just want to know what other McDonalds this Franchisee owns so I can avoid those also.

Review 0: 7/12/14 @12:15 had lunch here! Everyone & everything was on point. I've had so many bad experiences at Mc Donalds but for these guys I decided to make a yelp account just for this! Chicken nuggets and fries were perfectly crispy and the whole drive through crew was amazingly nice and they got our order right which is a gigantic plus in my book. Thanks for making our stay in Vegas even better! Going again today! Hehehe


Review 1: Had to use the drive thru, because I was on a road trip with my puppies, and it is just too darn hot in NV to leave them in the car for any reason.  That said, I got an iced coffee and some fries, as that was all I could find on the menu that was vegetarian.  Now I remember why I don't go here.  Then I realized, if I could have only found a Taco Bell, I could have had real food!


Review 2: I bought a filet-o-fish and asked for a large cup of ice. They charged me $1 for a cup of ice...fail!


Review 3: The worst mc Donald's in Las Vegas trust me I love here. I been there many times because I use to go to school down the street from there and every single time, every single time, they gave me the wrong order or didn't give me my drink or had to wait 20 minutes for my order. To make it worst the drive thru is not fast by any means either, ur looking at at least 15 minutes over the limit. It's on a busy location but they don't seem to care because the place is always dirty, napkins on the floor and ketchup all over the tables; to make it worse the restrooms are disgusting. If you are hungry don't go here at all, at all!!! No customer service and dirty as hell location

Review 0: This is the newest McDonald's in North Las Vegas, and possibly the Vegas Valley. In similar fashion to newly opened businesses, this one starts out on a clean slate. ...  ...    The atmosphere is upbeat because everything is brand new and clean. With the newness, there is some neat features. The one that stands out is a screen similar to the DMV that flashes your order number when it is ready. In similar fashion to new and remodeled McDonald's, there is a McCafe and indoor playground.. ...  ...   The employees appear cheerful. The service was fast and friendly. ...  ...   I am a fan of new businesses. Especially new McDonald's that are upbeat restaurants. I bestow the newest North Las Vegas McDonald's with 4-stars.


Review 1: Food can be so-so at times and service can be slow.


Review 2: This McDonald's gets bonus points for its newness factor.  There's also a playground for the kiddos. It seems like it's busy most of the time, but the employees sure try their best to crank out orders as fast as possible.  Another plus- the employees actually smile and are friendly!  The restaurant area is clean and thus far all my orders have been correct.  This is probably my favorite McDonald's location.

Review 0: I agree with the last reviewer, they have fly problem. We were annoyed with this issue the last time we decided to go inside.


Review 1: FLY PROBLEM!!!!!!!!!!!!  Spoke w/manager on duty.  McDonald's will not let them have fly strip!  Makes me wonder how sanitary the food is!  We have a child!  Never coming back to this McDonald's!!!!!!!


Review 2: Stupidity is the name of the game here.  Don't ask any questions about anything because no one knows #$% ...  ... They refuse to park cars with big orders so the whole damn drive up backs up around the building.  Don't bother going in either....goto Subway or Arbys.  They are in the same town and do a better job.

Review 0: Let me preface this by saying that I'm usually a Burger King guy (I like their mascot better, McDonald's is too funny looking). ...  ... However, my friend was in town, and I thought, "why the heck not? live a little!" so I brought her here. ...  ... On our way to McDonald's, also known as "Mickey D's" in other areas, I begin to worry that maybe I should have called to reserve a table in advance. ...  ... However, upon arriving, we were pleasantly surprised to find no line!!  ...  ... We did wait a minute or two to be seated, but apparently, this is one of those seat yourself places.   ...  ... As I approached the front, I was immediately mesmerized by their huge selection of burgers. Their menu ranged from McSingles to McDoubles to even McTriples!! They also had a dollar menu consisting of items costing $1.07 after tax.  ...  ... I decided to go with their house special, The Big Mac, and their seasonal Chicken "McNugget" Pieces. ...  ... When I opened up my box of chicken nuggets, the pale-golden/yellow skin indicated that it had just came out of the storage unit next to the fryer.  ...   ... As the freshness evaporated with every bite, I really began to taste all the other kinds of meat that went into making the nuggets. I think I even tasted some pork, but don't take my word for it.  ...  ... Oh my God and then you have the dipping sauces! These little containers held the perfect blend of artificial sweetener and manufactured taste   ...  ... As I eagerly unwrapped my Big Mac, I was slightly disappointed to find that it wasn't as advertised (the picture on the display made it seem a lot bigger!!). Oh well. ...  ... I would really like to commend the chef on making the buns just how I like them, extremely soggy. I was even more impressed that the soggy, limp buns were able to maintain their round form. This is some pretty advanced cooking technique!! ...  ... Anyways, as I bit into my Big Mac, the first thing I tasted was the mayo. Actually, it was the only thing I tasted, but it was some damn good mayo.  ...  ... Finally, if you're watching your waistline, they have a plethora of drink options. Choices like Diet Coke, Diet Coke Zero, Sugar-free Diet Coke Zero, etc... ensures that there's a perfect diet drink for everyone.  ...  ... PS: Perfect date spot for Valentine's Day. Highly recommended!!


Review 1: I broke down and was craving McDonald's and wanted to check out the newly built one. Ordered the new bacon clubhouse burger. It was tasty but on the cooler side of hot. Once again though fries as bad as you can get. Cold, dried out and down right uneatable. I do like that they have coke zero even as it wasn't mixed properly.  ... Service, what service. No warm welcome or even a smile and it was a manager who was besides himself for having to leave his set position to help me the only customer at noon in line.  ... Dining room looks great new. Dirty as all hell. Looked to sit at 3 high tables and all the seats had greasy soda spots all over them.  ... How hard is it to manage a place like this. I've done it quiet successfully for many years.  ... And yes someone can contact me if they'd like.

Review 0: Ok, we all know Mcdonalds is good for having to endure horrible attitudes, missing food and more attitudes when you complain. Well the first time I was right as usual lol! The lady who took my order was as rude and just plan ugh as she could be! I had to come back because she left out nearly everything I ordered. So I came back and she was like oh I apologize in such a somber voice and offered 3 dollar menu coupons (Take it they keft out almost 10 dollars worth of food). I took it and gave the manager a call the nest day and she was very apologetic and had me come in. She not only remade my order but asked me anything that I wanted and added it to it. All said and done I left out with almost 50 bucks of free food! So Kudos to them! Thanks!


Review 1: This is a McDonald's.  The food tastes the same no matter which one you go to, and it's perfectly fine for a late-night fast food fix.  However, this one will never give you the correct food.  Even if employees outnumber patrons three to one, you had better open up every box to make sure you get what you ordered.  Not just look in the bag.  Look in the boxes. ...  ... The employees are friendly enough when you point out their mistakes.  It's not like they're maliciously screwing up your order.  But an order consisting of a Double Quarter-pounder with cheese (yes, that's TWO WHOLE PATTIES, WITH CHEESE), two apple pies and an order of fries should not be difficult to assemble.  You want an Angus burger?  It's a toss-up whether what comes on the burger is even close to what you ordered.   ...  ... I don't want to think about what this place turns into during the lunch rush.

Review 0: This might be the best run McDonalds in the Madison area. The drive-through runs incredibly fast! Plus, it's a throw back McDonalds with a displayed old milkshake machine that triggered Ray Kroc's involvement in the company, and resulted in him bringing in a franchise model that facilitated the restaurant's world-wide domination. However, who checks for a McDonalds rating?


Review 1: Hard to rate a McDonald's well.  I go through the drive thru most mornings for coffee and will eat lunch there from time to time.  Drive thru service is always great and restaurant is always clean.  They hire and retain good help.


Review 2: I ate here on Dec 1st (big mac combo) and it did not feel well after words. I learned that they and all Mc D's use ammoniated beef, it is frank'in food. Madison is full of privately owned restaurants that serve real food, not chemical and byproducts dressed up as food. Save your kids, save your self. Just say no to the evil fake food

Review 0: Always clean and the staff are very pleasant. The playplace is a good way for kids to get excersize on cold winter days. ...  ... Brought my kids here one day to give my pregnant wife a break and bought them a hamburger and nuggets. One of the managers (I think his name was George) threw in two Happy Meal toys just to be nice. He probably thought it was no big deal, but I was touched by the gesture.


Review 1: This is the best McDonalds I have ever experienced!  Great service, alway polite, and fast drive-thru.


Review 2: I cannot believe I'm reviewing a McDonald's, but I've been to this location three times, and all three visits have been less than stellar.   ...  ... For starters, the "drive thru" system is anything but convenient.  Getting in-and-out via the drive-thru requires you to take 2 full laps around the building - the way the entrance is configured, you must enter their parking lot via the side of the property.  You then drive counter-clockwise around the building to the spot where you order.  Then you drive to get your "food," at which point you're beyond the entrance/exit spot.  So, you have to take another counter-clockwise spin around the parking lot before you can exit. ...  ... It's a terribly inefficient system, and it's somewhat dangerous, as drivers leaving the primary drive-thru lane with their food rarely look for cars circling the building trying to get to the drive-thru.  It's difficult to explain... but go there once, and you'll understand what I'm trying to describe. ...  ... Ok... entrance/egress aside, let's talk about this location.  It's a McDonald's, so the food is going to be exactly the same as you'd find from any other McDonald's in the world (thanks corporate farming/food prep/chemistry!), which means the service makes or breaks the experience. ...  ... Today's experience was especially interesting/frustrating.  I was in Verona, helping a coworker with some home improvement work.  It was around midmorning, and his kids were in the mood for McD's.  Since I was the cleanest of the group, I volunteered to drive and pick-up the grub.  I hopped into the car and made my way over to Mickey Ds, where the drive thru was backed-up (thanks to lack of dual ordering points). ...  ... When I reached the spot to order, I started placing the order.  I don't often go to McDonald's, so I'm not terribly familiar with the protocol... the first item on my list was identified as a "large #3 with Coke."   ...  ... McD's Microphone Dude: "Sir, Sir, Sir - I'm sorry, sir - we don't have a large size breakfast item, we only do that at lunch and dinner, sir." ...  ... Me: "Oh?  So they can't get a large Coke?" ...  ... MDMD: "Sir, I'm sorry, we only have one size for breakfast - we don't have large size breakfasts." ...  ... Me: "Ok?  I only need a large Coke with that #3.  Not trying to Supersize or anything, just adding a large Coke." ...  ... MDMD: "Sir, no - sir, we don't Supersize any longer.  We have large drinks, but we don't Supersize, and we only have one size for breakfast." ...  ... Me: "Let's start over.  Could I have a #3 - the biscuit thing, with a Large Coke?" ...  ... MDMD: (long pause) "Do you want a large Coke?" ...  ... Me: "Yes, and the #3." ...  ... MDMD: (long pause) "So, that's a #3 with large Coke?" ...  ... Me: "Yes." ...  ... MDMD: "Ok." ...  ... Me: (long pause) "Can I continue with the order?"  (looked at screen thing and saw that he got the #3 with large Coke correct) ...  ... MDMD: (long pause) "Yes." ...  ... Me: ...ordered rest of meals for friend and his kids... ...  ... MDMD: Ok, if everything looks correct, proceed to the first window, where we'll have your total ready. ...  ... Me: ...drives around... ...  ... Kid at window: "That'll be $18.14." ...  ... Me: "Sorry for the confusion - I thought you could order a large beverage with your breakfast meal." ...  ... Kid at window: "You can." ...  ... Me: "So, why all of the confusion?" ...  ... Kid: "I don't take the orders here, I just take the money. They take the order at the next window." ...  ... Me: "Oh, ok." ...  ... So, I go to the next window and the kid explains that he thought I wanted a large sized hash browns, and went to great length to explain that they don't have large hash browns, only regular size.  Ok, whatever... ...  ... I returned to my friend's house only to discover they forgot to include the #3 part of the food order... so, we got the large Coke, but no biscuit or hash brown.  UGH!  I gave away my breakfast in the interest of not having to return. ...  ...  ... Previous visits included a bout with cold/hard fries and a botched burger order (asked for onions only; got everything but onions), and a less than enthusiastic balding manager dude who seemed to act as if someone had just stomped on his toes a few seconds before I arrived to his window. ...  ... Thanks to this McDonald's, I'm convinced that I won't need to visit another McDonald's ever again.  I think I'll go watch Supersize Me again, just for good measure.


Review 3: Bad


Review 4: DO NOT DO THE DRIVE THROUGH. ... I used to be a regular, but after being charged for wrong orders, given the wrong food and wrong drinks-I am allergic to diet sodas and today I specifically asked to verify it was regular, after the manager blew me off "yeah yeah'.  They are so disorganized and confused. 2 order stations i not always a good idea.  Especially if you can't train staff to do it right.


Review 5: Yuck! I wouldn't come here if I was starving! Tell your kids NOT to go on the PlayPlace. I  saw kids licking the playplace. I once threw up after eating a so-called "burger" from here. Overall rating: F.
