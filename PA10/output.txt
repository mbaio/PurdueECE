REVIEW #1:  4 stars  (540 chars)
I love Capriotti's! I used to go to them a lot in Vegas when I lived there. Then I saw a coming soon sign for them and all most crashed my car rubber necking to make sure I wasn't seeing things. After not having any for almost 2 years I was so excited to walk-in to a Capriotti's. I was not disappointed! ...  ... The food is great and I highly recommend the Bobbie or the Capastrami!! ...  ... Only down side is there a bit pricey. In the end it's worth it and I'm very happy I don't have to drive 4.5 hours anymore to get a specialty sub.

REVIEW #2:  4 stars  (638 chars)
So I see all these negative reviews and, rather than deterring me from going back to Capriotti's, what are my thoughts? "Great, shorter lines for me!" Really, no joke. ...  ... Okay so in all fairness I only ever eat one thing here. Which never happens. Ever. Here though, I always get the Cran Slam Club, and it never, ever fails to satisfy. I think I may have tried something else at a different location years ago... but since I tried that club, there's been no going back. ...  ... Oh and to the person complaining about a limited selection of chips, quick tip: Go to the counter where you ordered...... look down. You're welcome. :-)

The turkey, cranberry and stuffing sandwich is amazing.

REVIEW #4:  4 stars  (184 chars)
They claim the best sandwich in America. I'm going to agree that they are really really really good. They also deliver. The Bobbie, Cheese-steak, and the Capastrami are all crazy good!

REVIEW #5:  3 stars  (681 chars)
On occasion I get the urge for a big old Italian grinder.  In my neighborhood I know exactly where to go to to satisfy this craving, but I have no clue where to go in North Scottsdale.  I took a chance on Capriotti's. ...  ... The restaurant was packed, but the staff was very efficient in getting food out.  Grinder in hand, I head back to work to try it out. ...  ... The sandwich was huge, easily big enough for two meals.  As for the flavor?  It was ok, but not exactly memorable. All of the components were there, but the sandwich as a whole didn't stand out. ...  ... I'm willing to try the 'Best Sandwich in America' at least once, but I won't be going back for the grinder.

REVIEW #6:  3 stars  (1748 chars)
So I've seen the "opening soon" sign for some weeks now and was excited for a new sandwich place in the neighborhood. After kicking my own booty at the gym I was starved and craving meat. I decided to negate my work out efforts and give Capriottis a try.  ...  ... I was really conflicted on whether I should go for the meatball or the Philly cheese steak. Cheese steak won. Small size with mushrooms and onions. And a small drink. Just under $11. I had to gasp for air as I felt like someone just punched me in the gut and mugged me. This better be way YUM!  ...  ... When the sandwich came out I calmed down a little about the price. The small is 9" (giving all other small subs out there major feelings of inadequacy) and turned into two meals for me. It reheated very well the next day, I might add.  ...  ... The sandwich was tasty. Nothing to write home about. I really like their bread. It's funny, the other guy complained not enough meat and I would really liked to have seen more mushrooms and onions in my sub. The onions are diced and very small so I had a difficult time detecting their flavor, same goes for the mushrooms.  ...  ... I was disappointed when they told me they didn't have malt vinegar. I love dipping my cheese steaks in that stuff. The guy suggested red wine vinegar and I was so desperate I tried it. It was pretty good. Still can't beat malt though. Hopefully they will get enough requests for it and add it to their inventory.  ...  ... It is obvious they just opened and are working out some kinks here and there. Totally understandable and nothing to give them a hard time about. I will be back for more.  ...  ... Oh! And they deliver! Since we don't have a JJ in delivery range I am thrilled about that fact. :)

REVIEW #7:  3 stars  (964 chars)
The "Best Sandwich in America" sign should probably be taken down.  Don't get me wrong; Capriottis isn't bad.  It's actually pretty good.  But the best?  Not even close.  I don't think I would even call it the best sandwich in the retail complex it's located in. ...  ... Having never eaten at any of this national chain's locations, I decided to go off the Cap's Special menu and order a Capastromi (a pastrami rueben sub).  The small is 9 inches, which is big enough for me.  The bread is soft and tasty, but the pastrami is a little over peppered, and it would've been nice if there were more meat.  Very good.  But not the "Best" of anything. ...  ... The employees were friendly.  The seating area is spacious and clean.  There's two TV's playing ESPN and CNN in mute.  There's also a few tables located right outside, which would be pleasant spots to eat on a nice day.  Caprioittis may not be the "best" that it boasts, but I would certainly eat here again.

REVIEW #8:  3 stars  (495 chars)
We have some friend who were RAVING about this place, so we popped in for a sandwich before a movie recently.  I gotta say, I had a great reuben sandwich that I was VERY pleased with.  I'm not sure if I will be venturing to the area just to have this sandwich again, but it was super tasty.  Everyone seemed to like what they had and the menu has something for everyone.  If I'm in the area again, I might venture here, but I am partial to Jimmy John's (next door) so it might be hard to choose.

REVIEW #9:  2 stars  (547 chars)
Chicken Cheese Steak with onions, pickles, peppers. Good flavor, but short on meat. Fresh soft roll, but it's a lot of bread when it's light on meat. Good news, it's something different than the neighbors (jj), Bad news was 10 minutes later my stomach did a flip from the grease and I spent my evening in the bathroom. ugh ... Expensive Sammiches then again we are in North Scottsdale! ... Will I try them again? Sure. I'd like to try the Bobbie nexttime around, though I'm not a chain-store fan. I'd rather find the mom & pop shop with real food.

REVIEW #10:  2 stars  (2486 chars)
I've been to this place twice.  ... The first time was during a very busy lunchtime and the Tuna sandwich I had was pretty good.  It was a little hard to manuever around the tightly placed tables and chairs but that was about the only thing I had an issue with the first time.   ...  ... The second time I went with my daughter in the late afternoon when there was no-one else in the restaurant except a group of men who worked for Capriotti's who were having a business meeting at one of the tables.  When I ordered and paid for my meal I gave the cashier my money and watched as she LICKED HER INDEX FINGER and proceeded to take money out of the drawer and hand it to me as my change.  I was so disgusted and asked her "did you just lick your finger and then put use it to pull out the dollar that you just gave me"?  She shrugged and said "yeah".  I told her that it was gross and I didn't appreciate having her spit on the money that I was putting back into my wallet.  She just shrugged again.  Well I know money is dirty and all and who knows where the money has been that I already have in my wallet so oh wel...BUT THEN I watched her stick that SAME FINGER into the inside of my drink cup as she handed it to me.  I just looked at her and said" this is unbelievable".  I didn't bother saying anymore to her because I had a feeling she would just shrug again.  Well then I was really grossed out and just couldn't stomach filling my drink cup after she stuck her spitty finger in it so I was standing at the drink machine trying to decide what to do when one of the men from the meeting stood up and walked past me.  As he walked by I asked him if he worked there and he said "yes, do you need something"?  I said yes I need a new cup  because the cashier licked her finger to slide a  dollar bill out of the drawer then stuck that same finger inside my cup to hand it to me.  His reaction to this?  "ok, let me get you another cup.  Not "I'm sorry maam that is not the way we train our employees" or any other sort of apology or "I will discuss this with the employee and make sure it doesn't happen in the future"....nope he just handed me another cup and said "here you go".  Well I guess I could have pushed for an apology or something but I was just too disgusted to speak and decided that I just would never return to Capriotti's again.   ...  ... Just thought some of you out there would like to know what my experience was. ... I gave them two stars because the Tuna sand

REVIEW #11:  2 stars  (402 chars)
Meat was very salty & was poor quality..was excited to try it but very disappointed.  I went with my wife and friend and we all love subs and have tried many and we all felt that it was ok!  The bread wasn't that great either..It seems like the other locations have better reviews but nonetheless, its still the same meats and bread.  I would rather go to Jimmy Johns, Jersey Mikes or Hangover Hoagies.

REVIEW #12:  2 stars  (365 chars)
Nothing like Capriotti's in other cities.  They don't have the same menu offerings as east coast locations, and even though I ate here when not busy it took a very long time for the food to arrive.  Parking is frustrating too because of the adjacent Starbucks patrons occupying so many spots.  Very poor chips selection as well - only two choices.  Really? 2 chips?

REVIEW #13:  1 stars  (1111 chars)
Did you know that Marky Mark is the same person as Mark Wahlberg? ...  ... And why did I mention this?  Because that is what the three workers (one I know was a manager) were debating about while I was waiting for my sandwich...and sandwich that was waiting to be handed to me.  Five minutes later....my name was called....another employee gave it to me...while the three guys were still talking about Marky Mark.   ...  ... I was told that I had to go to this "amazing sandwich"...the best sandwich in America.  Well...service wise...this place is awful.  The guy taking my order had severe ADD...(would you like a drink with that?  "No thank you"...ok would you like a regular or large drink?  Or!  "What is the total?"  Moron behind the counter..."The cookie is $1.29)  Food wise?  There was nothing...absolutely NOTHING about that sandwich (Chicken Cheesesteak)  that would make me forget about the bad counter service so I would go back.  The chicken was bland and extremely greasy.  I am still feeling the effects of the pit in my stomach of bottomless grease. ...  ... Sorry Caprioti's....not going back.

REVIEW #14:  1 stars  (822 chars)
The sandwich was a 2 Star disappointment and when you combine the price this place really earns the lowest rating.  I ordered the Medium Philly with mushrooms and hots on the side along with a small drink- $13.50 what a rip off. (I didnt even get a side or chips what would that have been $15.+) These sandwiches don't even make the average persons top 100 so the sign sets you up for a big let down.  This business should do themselves a favor and remove this blatantly false advertising.  Even a fast food joint like Arbys and their $5.00 Philly is much better.  First time I've wanted to go back and tell them to their faces how below average they really are but its not the folks working hard behind the counters fault so Ill just leave it here.  Save your dime and try almost any other sammie for a better experience.

REVIEW #2:  5 stars  (211 chars)
Fantastic sandwiches that have that wow factor while staying simple. Love the russian slaw sandwiches but the crown jewel is the Bobbie...It's like heaven in a roll. Wish there were more locations in California.

REVIEW #3:  5 stars  (972 chars)
I've never had a better mushroom cheesesteak than at capriotti's, and I've been to philly. The bread is always fresh, the steak is always hot and peppered perfectly, the onions and mushrooms are cooked to perfection and the cheese is gooey and delish!! ...  ... Went to capriotti's Saturday night for two sandwiches, apparently they were really busy all day, but they had just enough bread for two. It was 745 pm and they were down to the last two buns, perfect! The lady had a bobbie, with extra cranberries and I had the regular mushroom cheesesteak with onions, which is my standard order. The sandwiches did not disappoint, never do. ...  ... This shop is voted "best in vegas" every year for a reason, I'm so glad they opened this location about a year and a half ago because its right around the corner from where I live and the next closest was at silv ranch and lv blvd which is about 10 mins away. I can walk to this one!  ... 5 star experience, just like always.

Just having some left over Bobbie sandwich from yesterday. Its even better the day after (kinda like macaroni and cheese).  How is that possible? Keep up the good work my boys...you rock the house :)

REVIEW #5:  5 stars  (161 chars)
The best lunch in the southwest part of the valley.  Staff is friendly, food is very good and the place is always clean!  Best lunch under $12.00.  Is very true!

REVIEW #6:  5 stars  (147 chars)
While Capriotti's does offer the standard sub selections, it's the more creative (and more tasty!) options that set Capriotti's heads above others.

REVIEW #7:  4 stars  (885 chars)
I LA LA LA LOVE this Capriotti's. The staff is hilarious (obviously from the east coast) and they always make me smile (prime example was the time I was seriously illin' so I dragged my butt to Capriotti's to pick up dinner for my family. I walk in looking like crap but I managed to put on my nifty AC/DC tshirt....the guy looks at me and says "Any chick who likes AC/DC should be able to handle a little cold." Needless to say it made me giggle). I ordered the Bobbie (AMAZING...its like Thanksgiving dinner on a tasty roll) and a Philly cheesesteak with mushrooms and onions....throw in some salt and vinegar chips, a couple of rootbeers and we had dinner (albeit not very nutritious but hey, I felt like I was knocking on death's doorstep). ...  ... All in all Capriotti's is my favorite sandwich place. The only reason its not getting 5 stars is because they close too dang early.

REVIEW #8:  4 stars  (297 chars)
Their best sandwich is the Bobbie,  the Capistrami is a close second.  I am not a cheese steak fan,  but they do an alright cheese steak.  Best part is you can get a large with some Wise chips and feed the whole family under $15.00 and $18 with drinks.  Great deal in a town of little to no deals.

REVIEW #9:  3 stars  (973 chars)
Overhyped. Capriotti's has some good sandwiches and some that just don't connect. ...  ... My favorite sandwich here is the Capastrami, greasy pastrami grilled with melted Swiss, generously topped with creamy cole slaw and Russian dressing. Reubenesque and held together well by the bread. ...  ... Unfortunately, that same bread is the reason why Capriotti's cheesesteaks and Italian subs don't work. The rolls on which its subs are served are hard and dense, which means they don't absorb the favors and moisture of the rest of the sandwich. ...  ... The cheesesteaks also suffer from meat that's grisly, dry and flavorless. Bland would be a word for it. ...  ... The Bobbie isn't my thing - I think mayo is gross, and without it the Bobbie sandwich gets unbearably dry. That being said, the store roasted turkey goes great on cold subs with provolone and hot peppers. ...  ... Jersey Mike's is better for cold subs and Pop's is the place to go in Vegas for cheesesteaks.

REVIEW #10:  2 stars  (601 chars)
family ordered the philly cheesesteak and the italian to share. it was ordered to go so we could eat at home. we ordered mushrooms on the philly and they forgot them. the philly cheesesteak was really bland and the meat tasted dry. no cheesewiz was used here. we got peppers in a side cup to put on ourselves and that didn't help with flavoring. the italian was the more flavorful of the two, but not my favorite. i have experienced better from capriottes. hopefully last night was just an off night from them from watching the game. please step your game back up capriottes because i use to love you.

REVIEW #11:  2 stars  (767 chars)
Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me. I don't like to knock a business until I've had a bad experience more than once. This Capriotti's is the closest to me house so I've been here several times, and the last few experiences have been horrible. ...  ... I love the Bobbie and the Capastrami. The last time I ordered, my stomach was churning after eating the Capastrami. It tasted a little off but I ate it anyway. Boy did I regret it. ...  ... Whet really bugs me is their bad customer service. One time I walked in, and the girl just looked at me without a "Hi" or "How may I help you?" And they are just as rude over the phone. The staff really seem like they hate their job. ...  ... I still like Capriotti's but I won't go back to this location.

REVIEW #12:  2 stars  (2486 chars)
I was getting ready to install a new stereo in our car and wanted to grab something quick for dinner that was still delicious and easy to eat so what better than snatching up some Capriottis right? Well, I was very very let down this time. We called into the store to make the order and everything seemed great at that point since they took down the order and read it back perfectly. Soon after that the things to come should have been a fair warning. ...  ... Upon walking into this location all of the tables were occupied by very gloomy looking folks almost pissed off looking and not a single one of them had a sandwich on the table. There was a gentlemen in line before me picking up a to go order and as I stood there waiting I watched as the guy cooking everything was literally running full sprints around the back trying to get sandwiches made, and the upset patrons seemed to get even more in the dumps by seeing someone get in line.  ...  ... Before I tell you what went down with my grub let me give you our order, 1 med capastrami with extra Russian dressing, 1 med capastrami with hot peppers and mushrooms, 1 med Bobbi. All seems simple right, considering it is basically a order of all things Capriottis the basic we are known for this type sandwiches. My order was ready pretty quick so we grabbed them and went on to the house to get our grub on and upon unwrapping what should have been a delicious monstrosity of a sandwich in turn was a dry overcooked lump of letdown... The bread was so crazy dry it was like eating dry oats and to top that off the pastrami was cooked so long it was truly like chewing leaves... Not that I have chewed on leaves before. The final straw for me was that I order Capriottis at work quite a bit and when you order it with hot peppers and mushrooms they are cooked into the meat just the way I like it and for some reason the cook put my sandwich together and then threw raw hot pepper on top of the slaw and then raw mushrooms... ummmm, that is not how its done. ...  ... In my opinion a sandwich is one of those things that you look forward to eating for some reason, that is great when your sandwich is awesome but when you get a bad sandwich it is almost as bad as if someone kicked your dog or something. I wish this review was to say how amazing the sandwiches were and that I am sporting a new Capriottis shirt and hat because that sandwich was so good I want to be a poster boy, unfortunately that is not the case. I don't know

REVIEW #13:  1 stars  (1376 chars)
Capriottis is good...don't get me wrong but what gets me going back to a place is the staff and the service they give.   ... Once in a while I crave the SLAW BEJO and the BOBBIE.  This particular place is nearby my home and makes it convenient to order here and take my goody home to enjoy in front of the telly. ... When it first opened, I remember the guy that helped me.....tall, goatee...and I don't know if he has teeth cuz he never smiles.  (lol jk). ... I remember now that he was not friendly and I didn't want to go there again.   ... Well.....it's been a while and I guess I forgot how sucky the customer service is there.   ... Went there again and for the last time.  The same guy was still working there and still no smile...trying to rush me when I was trying to decide what to order.  When he was finished....rang up my stuff...NOT A THANK YOU....I was signing the receipt and he practically yanked it from me cuz I was trying to figure out which receipt to keep and which to give.  I should have said right there and then I wanted my $$$ back.  I should have gotten his name also.  But I will not forget his face that's for sure.  --and I will remember to NOT PATRONIZE this one sandwich shop.  I will take the time to drive somewhere farther for GOOD CUSTOMER SERVICE and a smile.   ... For those who do not care.....this is the place to go for SUCKY SERVICE.

REVIEW #14:  1 stars  (792 chars)
Not very impressed.  I had the homemade Turkey Sub and the turkey was really dry and shredded.  Imagine the worse Thanksgiving Day Dinner you ever had and throw it on a bun with two tomatoes, iceberg lettuce, provolone cheese and spices.  I expected more from the sandwich.  I asked why they called it homemade turkey and was told they roast there turkeys every night...seems like someone overcooked this bird.   ...  ... They have an award winning sandwich called the Bobbie but it kind of seemed gross...imagine someone taking your leftovers from Thanksgiving and throwing it on a bun...shredded turkey, stuffing, mayo and cranberries...you lost me at the cranberries.  I did not have this sandwich but the description seemed gross.  Someone must like it because someone gave it an award!!!

Capriotti's is excellent in general.  This location (in the Santa Fe Station Casino) is even better than most.  That's surprising considering that the casino smoke wafts right into their eating area.  But, the food is excellent, there's more seating in a less cramped environment, and we can buy refillable glasses of soda pop (our stand-alone Capriotti's only has bottles).

REVIEW #2:  5 stars  (391 chars)
The Bobbie sandwich is worth the hype. If you like Thanksgiving (which you should cause you're a patriot reading this) then you'll dig this sandwich. They made the sandwich in, no bs, 1 minute or less. I had just gotten my drink filed and it was ready. The manager was working the register and he was very courteous and professional. If you have a chance to get one of these wiches, GET IT!!

REVIEW #3:  4 stars  (803 chars)
Tucked away in the Santa Fe Station food court, Capriotti's seemed like the best choice of all the food options there. I usually go back and forth between the Bobbie and the Capistrami, and this time, I wanted a hot sandwich so I got a Capistrami before going to the movies. The combination and contrast of the hot pastrami combined with the cold slaw and russian dressing makes this an addicting sandwich that you take one bite after another until there is no more! ...  ... I ended up sneaking the other half of my sandwich in because we weren't keeping track of time and didn't wanna end up with junk seats, That was a great sandwich, and I prefer that any day over a bucket of outrageously priced popcorn with that fake butter...ALOHA!!! ...  ...

REVIEW #4:  3 stars  (695 chars)
I love Cap's; when I ate meat my favorite sub was the Slaw and Roast Beef, and the Bobbie is great of course :) But not only do they offer great meat subs, they have Vegetarian ones too!  ... They use a soy based sub for their veggie subs, and it tastes really good. I got the veggie version of the roast beef and slaw sub, and my dad got the Bobby. ... I was disappointed to see that they skimped on the soy turkey, so it was essentially all slaw. The Bobby was perfect though, so it just seems like they skimp out on the veggie subs at this location.  ... They also have a soda fountain that is accessable by patrons, so that's nice- you don't have to ask them for a refill, just get your own.

REVIEW #5:  1 stars  (498 chars)
Wow, worst food at a sandwich place. I ordred a plain Roast beef with mayo  and got old beef sawdust on a stale bun.  I  like Cap pretty much. This location is the dregs. They should be ashamed to be open. I usually do not write to a company to complain but I made a exception in this case. I hope they listen. Avoid this location at all costs. I think it may be one bad apple, but it can rot the bunch. Never rated the other locations I have been to, just took for granted that they had good food.

Is it possible to be in love with a sandwhich? I think so. I can't say one bad thing about Capriotti's. I used to be strictly a Subway girl (I know right!!) Before my fianc convinced me to try Capriotti's,  abd I'm so glad he did! ...  ... Everything tastes super fresh, and delicious! My favorite has to be tge steak abd cheese with the hot peppers, mushroom, and a little bit of mayo (it makes the hot peppers not so hot) I've also had thd Italian which was my go to sub before the steak and cheese. Salami ham provolone cheese on a fresh soft slice of bread you can't go wrong!  ...  ... You also have to try their signature sandwhich the "bobby." As I like to call itbits Thanksgiving in one sandwhich!  Roast turkey, stuffing and cranberry sauce! Absolute heaven! I know this review if for this Capriotti's on South Rainbow, but I have never had a bad experience at any of the Capriotti's that I have been to!

I've been to many Capriotti's in Las Vegas and this one was basically the same as the rest. Good service, yummy food. Someone started to order before us when we were there first and the person who was taking our order told the customer to wait because we were there first. I thought that was very nice of him and showed that he valued us.  ...  ... Got the bobbie this time! I loved it but I have to admit I missed the bits of crushed pepper that comes on their regular subs. I think next time I will have to ask them to add it on top of the sub. It's just to good to not have!

Small sandwiches are always big enough for two. Nice location but the eat-in scenery is not cozy, but seems small.  I only get take-out from here.

You can never go wrong with a Bobbie!

REVIEW #8:  3 stars  (242 chars)
It's capriotti's.  Decent sandwiches, very few good brands of chips, sterile restaurants. I'm just not totally faschnickered on this place and never have been, but it's okay. I might never crave capriotti's but I'll definitely eat here again.

REVIEW #9:  2 stars  (593 chars)
Service at this location is not as good as some other one's. I walked in and waited at the counter for maybe 5 mins. I was staring at the girl behind the counter either she didn't see me and was too busy with her current order or didn't care. At least acknowledge the fact that I'm there waiting for someone to take me order! A quick 'hi I'll be right with you' would have been nice! Also I order a mushroom cheese stake with onions and lettuce. It was a to-go order so once I opened it I found no lettuce....fail. It was my first time at this location but I was not impressed with this store.

#1 in Vegas for a reason.  Everyone has their favs.... the capistrami, the cheeseteak with mush...  Mine is definitely the Bobby.  In case you haven't viewed their menu yet, the bobby is thanksgiving leftovers in a huge sandwich... yeah, exactly.

REVIEW #2:  5 stars  (122 chars)
Awesome sandwich.  We had the Bobby on our first visit.  Thanksgiving on a bun!  Delicious.  Nice people too.  Good value.

REVIEW #3:  5 stars  (106 chars)
Been loving Capriotti's for years. Fresh cold cut sandwitches. They have the best hot n cold subs in town.

REVIEW #4:  5 stars  (438 chars)
best capriottis in the valley!!!!! have had a few if the subs but you can not beat the bobbie. its like a thanksgiving feast without having to deal with your crazy family. but this shop is on there A game, some of the shops i have been to cant seem to put the sandwich together so it will not fall apart when you eat it .  ...  ... dont be a cheap ass, Tip them. go there enough and do it and you might get expedited service during lunch.

REVIEW #5:  5 stars  (16 chars)
Best sandwiches.

REVIEW #6:  5 stars  (590 chars)
By far the best sub shop.  I haven't been to anyplace that had better tasting subs.  Just today I ordered a philly cheesteak with nothing but meat, cheese, and hot peppers and it was like an orgasm of the mouth.  The cheese was so melted into the spiced beef that it was almost like the beef was stirred in some sauce or something, hard to explain.  The peppers were hot which I loved.  I usually get the cold spicy Italian which is phenomenal as well, but today I tried something else.  Very happy with the service especially if you call it in ahead of time (no wait).  LOVE THIS PLACE!!!!

REVIEW #7:  5 stars  (791 chars)
I give this place 5 stars because it is by far the best sandwich shop of it's kind.  Subway and Port of Subs aren't even worth mentioning in the same breath.  The sandwiches are delicious and huge.  Unlike the other sub places, this place actually has a fair amount of meat and other items in between the bread.  Not like some places where you have to pay extra dollars just for enough meat to actually taste it.  For me, it's all abou the spicy italian, with lots of these tasty chopped peppers.  Sure it's not $5 to eat, but I would rather pay a few extra dollars and get a sandwich that is filling, and taste way better than all others.  There is a Subway pretty much in the same parking lot as my job, but I would rather drive a few miles down the road any day to get Capriottis instead.

REVIEW #8:  5 stars  (505 chars)
I have always loved Capriotti's and found they have the best philly cheese steaks in Vegas (and beyond).  ...  ... However, I decided to try the Tuna Sub yesterday and all I can say is WOW. Best Tuna Sub ever.  I never thought I would have to leave a great review for something as simple as a tuna sandwich, but after eating that one, I had to tell the world - lol. ...  ... So, I will continue to spread the good word about the great food at Capriottis and continue enjoying the best sandwiches in Vegas.

REVIEW #9:  5 stars  (201 chars)
I just had Capriotti's and their turkey with cranberry was one of the best sandwiches I've had in a long time. I hope a franchise opens up in Orange County, CA because I would be there every other day!

REVIEW #10:  5 stars  (387 chars)
My parents lived in Vegas for awhile and introduced me to this FANTASTIC sandwich place. Now every time I am anywhere near a Capriotti's, I have to go. I absolutely love the "real", Thanksgiving style turkey on it! No compressed mystery turkeyloaf here! The cheesesteaks are excellent too, just avoid the hot peppers unless you have a hankering to burn off a few of your tastebuds. YUM!!

REVIEW #11:  5 stars  (472 chars)
one New Year's resolution is to write more Yelp reviews, so here goes... ...  ... In Vegas for NYE & gave this place a shot per other Yelp reviews. I had the Capistrami & the girlfriend had the Cheese Steak, which I had few bites of. Both were absolutely delicious in an awesome-deli-sandwich-sort-of-way. The shop is no-frills with only some bar seating, but the sandwiches are really reasonably priced. So if all you're after is a fantastic deli sandwich, definitely go.

REVIEW #12:  5 stars  (178 chars)
The best cheese steak and pastrami sandwich in Vegas. this is a place for take out. They have a sitting area but its small and not to comfortable. But the sandwiches are great!!!

REVIEW #13:  5 stars  (888 chars)
The hype is real. Is this worth a $20 cab ride from the strip? Come on, it's just a sandwich. Let's not go crazy here... That being said, if you have a car/friend/etc, this place is incredible.  ...  ... What makes it so special? You know that slimy deli turkey meat stuff they serve at subway and well almost everywhere? They don't use that here.. they use real turkey that tastes like leftovers from thanksgiving. As everyone says, the bobbie really is thanksgiving on a bun. I thought stuffing, cranberry, and turkey would be kind of sick, but honestly it's incredible and you must try it. If you're looking for a sandwich place that's different than your everyday deli meat place, try here. The Cran Slam Club is also incredible (if you have a fear of stuffing or feel it doesn't belong on a sandwich), as is the cheesesteak if you're some freak that doesn't like thanksgiving turkey.

REVIEW #14:  5 stars  (505 chars)
The last time I went to Vegas was the first time I had Capriotti's. We had to go twice that weekend because it was so delicious. It's few and far between when you find a sandwich place that offers imitation meat for us vegetarian folk.  ...  ... The vegetarian philly cheesesteak sub is my favorite. The flavors are magical and the imitation meat they use is superb. The turkey sub is also very delicious, tastes a lot like a real turkey sandwich, comes with delicious veggies and served on a kaiser roll!

REVIEW #15:  5 stars  (320 chars)
With all due respect's to Jarred's July 1 review, I decided to test them and place a take-out order... Bobbie with extra mayo and cranberry. When I asked, they said it would be ready in 10 minutes. So, 10 mins later my sandwich was already waiting for me, (and well-made). Staff was cheerful and friendly. No complaints!

REVIEW #16:  4 stars  (264 chars)
Capistami Sandwich all the way!  YUM! ...  ... There's also a elvis look alike that works here - very entertaining. ...  ... Kicked back atmosphere inside.  Local magazines to browse while you wait to take out or eat at their bar.  (no alcohol served here though).

REVIEW #17:  4 stars  (194 chars)
Favorite Sub Sandwich shop in Las Vegas.  I like their turkey & stuffing & cranberry sauce sub sandwich.   Small seating area.  Take-out is better.  Mostly good folks working behind the counter.

REVIEW #18:  4 stars  (209 chars)
Had the HOT ITALIAN SUB (Genoa salami, ham and cappicola). The meat was piled high with pickles lettuce tomatoes and mustard. It really hit the spot. You can rely on this place to satisfy any sandwich craving.

REVIEW #19:  4 stars  (965 chars)
I am sure everyone has heard of Capriotti's but I have to add my two cents. Their sandwiches are so good, and a nice alternative to the chain sub shops. My personal favorite is the Bobbie, while my boyfriend always goes for the capistrami with double meat (ugh, why?). But here is my question, why are all of the staff beautiful young boys?! I have only seen one girl ever behind the counter at Capriotti's. The rest are these cute young things with a knack for making great subs, and girls sweat while they wait! I am in love and completely happy, but I am always begging my boy to go to Capriotti's. I think he is starting to catch on, but I don't care. Girls, Capriotti's has awesome sandwiches, and awesome eye candy while you wait...what could be better for lunch? (Caution: order in advance by phone, or you could get stuck waiting a bit...actually, this could be a good thing!) ...  ... Recommended sandwich: The Bobbie for a Thanksgiving-leftover-style sub.

REVIEW #20:  4 stars  (180 chars)
I love the Italian sub and the Bobbi's at Capriotti's. The sandwiches are huge and the meat is delicious! I always have the other half for lunch the next day. Check this place out!

REVIEW #21:  4 stars  (555 chars)
I'm so glad other people like the Capistrami here, I'm hooked on them!  Everytime we order them at work, I always get the Capistrami.  A lot of people don't like cole slaw, but I love it, and when it's on my sandwich, it's a win/win.  Their slaw is good typical, it's got a nice sweetness, but not as bad as KFC (whose slaw is just insanely sweet for no good reason).   The Capistrami is this-  Pastrami, Swiss Cheese, Russian dressing (1000 Island) and cole slaw.  It's simplicity in it's best.   And it's by far one of the best sandwiches I've ever had.

REVIEW #22:  4 stars  (211 chars)
In Vegas for 3 days, ate here twice and took 2 home! The Capistrami is outstanding! We also had  the Slaw Be Jo I think it was called? The meat was a bit dry, but the Capistrami and the service made up for it!!!

REVIEW #23:  4 stars  (275 chars)
Mmmmm, not usually a fan of coleslaw but theirs is good!! Went here 2-3 times and got the Capastrimi every single time. Now this is a sandwich that I can't finish since it's huge but it's delicious! I've only ate here when we have cars in vegas and when I'm not on the strip!

REVIEW #24:  4 stars  (217 chars)
Well, wouldn't you know, I just wrote a review and now I get to enjoy one!  Delicious, peppery/sweet, but not too sweet slaw.  Flavorful thinly sliced pastrami, just enough cheese and russian dressing.  I'm in heaven.

REVIEW #25:  3 stars  (133 chars)
All the workers seem like they were hungover and take 30 minutes to get a sandwich made wtf. ...  ... But the sandwich WAS good. haha

REVIEW #26:  3 stars  (234 chars)
Love this place, ordered a large italian, and a large steak and cheese. Very nice and fresh, hot and spicy.  ...  ... Little pricy but worth the money in my opinion,. ...  ... Order it for pick up. It was ready on time and good to go.

REVIEW #27:  3 stars  (408 chars)
My 2 favorites are the Mushroom Cheese Steak and the Cole Turkey. I would eat here more often if they would get different rolls. The French bread is horrible. We have even bought whole wheat rolls from the store and remade the sandwich. The Cole Turkey really does not need the Mayo as the Cole Slaw and Russian dressing are enough. A large 20" feeds 3 adults and is a great value. Please get some new rolls.

REVIEW #28:  2 stars  (335 chars)
1.5 - 2 stars ...  ... Yelp reviews say this place messes up your order a lot - didn't happen to me, however, it took the workers 15 minutes to make 2 sandwiches. ...  ... BF also says the grill was also yucky because it had a lot of junk on it. ...  ... Won't be back to this location due to service - but will be back to Capriotti's.

REVIEW #29:  2 stars  (632 chars)
Capriotti's is a very popular sandwich/sub shop in Las Vegas...  I have tried several locations and i do like their food... This location however, sucks my ass.  The steak sub was not filling as they usually are at other locations.  I asked for easy on the hot peppers, well they kinda over did it, completely making the sandwich un-edible..  Perhaps the saying easy on the hots, is beyond their comprehension. Their staff, what a bunch of tools...Food may be decent but the service, to me is a key factor in eating at a restaurant even if it is just a sub shop...  I recommend Capriotti's but not this location...   Hope this yelps

REVIEW #30:  2 stars  (734 chars)
It took like 20 mins for my sandwich, I asked if they had cappacola and they had no clue what that was... kinda strange but whatever. I didnt understand why it took soo long for my food, I order 1 small sub and I was the only person there... plus there were 3 workers! wtf?!  ...  ... I was like sooo super excited because I heard great things about this place! So I get to work and unwrap this mystical creature and bam! Its like my hard on went away! I asked politely for no tomatoes or onions... what do you think I see?! So I was like ugh. I sat there and poked out all the yuckiness and took a bite and almost choked because of the insane amount of pepper!  ...  ... I will not return, Ive had wayyy yummier sandwiches from 7-11.

REVIEW #31:  2 stars  (170 chars)
The sandwich was great!!!! But my concern was about the fact that is no restroom over there so I couldn't wash my hands,  and instead of eating over there I went home, );

REVIEW #32:  2 stars  (512 chars)
This review is for the location not the food. It seems kind of rough to me...including: the ex worker who came in and stated that if she was still working there no one would be smoking... they would be back here doing the dishes and cleaning the floor to the overall cleanliness or lack there of everything else. The window, walls, door, etc...need to be cleaned. I would think with the corporate headquarters in Las Vegas you would not find a store/location in this condition...it didn't get this way overnight.

REVIEW #33:  1 stars  (832 chars)
Came here yesterday while I got off from work, their was a few people ahead of me, both parties had their orders done wrong and while I was waiting in line after 15 mins and the line grew bigger I said I want to place an order, she told me I have to go in the front of the store to place the order. I waited 15 mins for the lady to fix peoples orders, and the line grew bigger and she had the nerve to tell me that? I walked right out. I was more embarrassed then anything as well. I heard people even wispering on how i stood their for that long to be told to go in the back of the line. So rude, she could have kindly still took my order and take it too the front line cooks as she did with 2 parties in front of me.  I will never go their again. All other Capriotti's will still take the order where ever you go inside the store.

REVIEW #34:  1 stars  (1494 chars)
I have to say first that I love Capriotti's. The sandwiches are delicious and the options are terrific. ...  ... However, this location's service has been poor to put it nicely. I let it slide the first time as a fluke, but the second time was nearly the same experience. The first time I called in an order shortly after 11 to beat the main lunch rush. When I arrived, they weren't exceptionally busy, but there were a few people there. I let them know I was there to pick up my order and I paid and started waiting. My bag was ready with 3 sandwiches and I was just waiting on one more. I literally waited 20 minutes for that last sandwich. I was asked several times what I was waiting for and I let them know, but that did not help. ...  ... The second time I decided to avoid the call-in debacle, so I ordered three sandwiches and brought two friends along to order 2 more each (we were picking up for our office). We were one of three orders they had to make at the time, so again, they were not slammed by any means. After a few minutes, my friends received their orders, but mine was waiting on ONE sandwich. I was asked again what I was waiting on and then informed them. Several minutes later and after 5 other groups got their orders, my sandwich was ready. I proceeded to the register and was ready to pay when they handed a call-in order to the person behind me and asked me to step aside so that they could pay. ...  ... What a slap in the face, I'll never return to this location.

REVIEW #35:  1 stars  (267 chars)
I was just about to place my order,  when I looked over the counter and saw how filthy it was.  The grill was black and food debris all over the counters. I immediately left and went to the Cappriotti's on Sunset and Annie Oakley. They are extremely clean. Thank God!

REVIEW #36:  1 stars  (697 chars)
I was visiting Vegas and we originally ordered from Capriottis on Warm Springs and Eastern but they constantly run out of roast beef and don't tell you until you are ready to pickup your order.  Again disappointed by this specific Capriottis we cancelled our order and went to JJs.   ...  ... The sandwich establishments are in different classes but JJs is reliable.   ...  ... I would have rated this review a 5 star instead of a 1 star if they would just tell me that they ran out of the specific ingredients before I drive down to be told they ran out of roast beef again.    ...  ... I'm a fan of their other locations to include the one in Dallas as they never seem to have a supply shortage.

REVIEW #37:  1 stars  (360 chars)
Poor quality food, always dry and unpleasant... A lot of employees enjoy talking trash about their employer in front of customers. Sandwiches made incorrectly often. Would not recommend. ...  ... The owner has resorted to writing poor reviews for her competitors businesses, now reducing their business rating down to 1 star, in my opinion. Extremely childish.

REVIEW #38:  1 stars  (564 chars)
The thing that frustrates me the most about yelp reviews is you don't know the level of taste from the people who are reviewing. This place was gross. The pastrami, which was one of their signature sandwiches was terrible. Soggy bread. Too much sauce, of course to cover up the quality of the meat. If you're a true foodie don't waste your time. ...  ... I did want to mention, to those foodies in search of something special, there is an Asian market in the same mall that has an off the hook hot food bar with homemade egg rolls and incredible Asian delectables.

REVIEW #39:  1 stars  (489 chars)
Their food is always very good, that is not the issue. This locations is a shit hole. It is so filthy and gross, if it were not for the fact that I was starving and the guy wore gloves so that I could watch him cook my meal, I would have left. Many of the Capriotti's need to get their acts together wtih cleanliness, namingly: Capriotti's near Anthem, E. Sunset Rd.and Stephanie St. Cesspools, everyone of them and I think that they are all the same owner. Shame on you all!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Capriotti's has the best turkey sub in all of America. They roast their turkeys everyday and the white rolls are of top quality. Go ahead and order the two footer you won't be disappointed. That's a whole days worth of food right there.

I like this location. It is close to home, always clean, and the staff are friendly. That is my trifecta right there! ...  ... The sandwiches are huge and super tasty.

My husband's favorite is the Capastrami.  ...  ... Do yourself a favor and swing by for an awesome sandwich that will make your tummy happy.

Ok, so I am NOT a fan of Delis AT ALL none.. I hate strange meat,meat thats been laying out under someone breathing all over it.. chopped meat that someone else has touched..blah, blah blah..Im a freak, I know. However, I was lured into this shop with a friend who swears that this place is the END ALL. I of course will have a bite of his because I am a snob who doesn't eat stuff like that. lol! He had to restrain me from demolishing his Capastrami Sandwich. That had to be THE BEST sandwich that ever crossed my lips. Tender meat, perfect coleslaw, perfect melted cheese and the bread? Fugetaboutit! Seriously.That sandwich made my heart happy! :o)  My only complaint is it wasn't hand fed to me by a rippling man in a loin cloth with my drink...lol!

The Bobbie, aka The World's Most Delicious Sandwich Ever. That is all.

REVIEW #7:  5 stars  (262 chars)
The bobby is the best sandwich ever made! I love it. $20 for a 20 inch sandwich is a great deal, half for now half for later. Can never go wrong with a great pulled turkey sandwich with cranberry sauce, stuffing, and added lettuce. If you never been you must go!

REVIEW #8:  5 stars  (1117 chars)
They say a sandwich can make or break a day. OK, maybe not. I say that, but by the amount of sandwiches I eat at Capriotti's, I may qualify for a "they". ...  ... When I moved to Vegas back in November, I saw a bunch of these Capriotti's locations around town. I also happened to see a Thrillist article about a new location in Beverly Hills (I moved here from LA). ...  ... I paid a visit to this location, and I've been back MANY times. I follow the company on Twitter (@capriottis) and even won a free sub for being a follower. Very interactive company and they WANT your business. ...  ... But I digress... ...  ... Their signature is obviously The Bobbie. Pulled Turkey, Cranberry Sauce, Stuffing and Mayo. Divine. Heavenly. Any other words that describe it? Angelic and pristine? It'll turn your tongue into Niagara Falls.  ...  ... Also the Grilled Italian, which I wont bother describing, because it's an experience all to itself. As is the Capostramie. ...  ... Aside from the great sandwiches, you have your choice of Wise chips, and TASTYKAKES! Prepare for an experience.  ...  ... It's worth the calories.

REVIEW #9:  5 stars  (1025 chars)
Top notch location! Anybody who has lived here long enough and loves Capriotti's knows that this is a old school location. Who knew it would grow to be so big and have locations all over? I did! Well, I dreamed haha. It is nice to have a Caps nearby no matter what area of town I am working so I can grab lunch. ...  ... Always clean inside and the staff are very friendly. I usually call my order in for convenience.This location can be so busy.  The "Capastrami" is my fav. If you love pastrami, coleslaw, and thousand island dressing then this is the sandwich for you. ... I love to stop by before heading to the nearby Doc Romeo park. The paper they wrap the sandwiches in carries well. My man tries the "Cheese Steak" and I sampled a bite. It isn't a true cheese steak and would go elsewhere for that type of sandwich. Good thing there is a variety of options. They have vegetarian options too! ...  ... The parking lot is sometimes cramped but who cares when you know you're going to eat one of these delicious gems?!?!

Bobby! Cole Turkey!!! Slawbie Joe!!!!!!  ...  ... Oh shit, you guys have no clue what I'm talking about if you've never been to Capriotti's. Their standard subs including homemade turkey and homemade roast beef are fantastic by themselves but their specialty sandwiches are what really elevates this place to epic status. ...  ... The Bobby is the standard Turkey Dinner sub including turkey, cranberry sauce, stuffing. Everything seems homemade and delicious and the price for what you're eating is really hard to beat. The Cole Turkey and Slawbie(sp?) Joe both have a base of Russian dressian and a really yummy coleslaw, the only difference being that one is Turkey and one is Roast Beef. I wonder which is which? Hmmmm ...  ... Anything you order here will make your stomach happy so go nuts! Sadly, this location is run by young kids who basically get your order wrong one out of every 3 times so beware. Capriotti's as a whole gets 5 stars but I'll knock off half a star for the haphazard service.

REVIEW #13:  4 stars  (786 chars)
First time here and ordered the Bobbie, Thanksgiving dinner on a bun (turkey, stuffing, cranberry sauce, mayo).  Bread was fresh and everything was seasoned nicely.  We got the medium size (12") and wow, it must have weighed about 2 pounds!  Plenty of food for myself and my hubby.  We were the only ones in the shop at the time, so our order was processed pretty quickly.  I don't know how busy this place gets, but I believe one should phone in one's order to save time.  Something I noticed: the floors were a little bit dirty, not so much to dissuade me from trying a sandwich, but just enough to wonder why it wasn't cleaner, especially when there was time and opportunity to attend to it?  I'll come here again to try a different sandwich....and to see if the floor's cleaner.  :)

REVIEW #14:  4 stars  (304 chars)
I gotta say the Bobbie has to be one of my favorite sandwiches ever.  I absolutely love all the componets that make the sandwich.  Especially the cranberry I appreciate the fact it's not the jello like stuff you get in a can.  For me it's what makes the sandwich.  The capstrami is another good sandwich.

REVIEW #15:  4 stars  (498 chars)
I have to visit this place every time I'm in town!!! ...  ... I order a medium turkey sandwich with cheese, mayo, onions and seasonings. That's it!  ...  ... The turkey is roasted fresh daily. They shred it there. The bread is always fresh and tasty.  ...  ... Sometimes you'll have to wait a while for your sandwich, but let me tell you, it is worth waiting for! ...  ... By far, one of the best sandwiches in town. I wish we had them in Southern California. They put Subway and Quizno's to shame.

REVIEW #16:  4 stars  (309 chars)
If you feel like eating a sandwich you definitely have to come to capriotti's.. they offer several different options but their most popular are their capastrami and their Bobby (must to try it) the mix of the ingredients does not sound that good, but believe me once you put it on your mouth you will love it.

REVIEW #17:  4 stars  (579 chars)
If you've never had a Capriotti's, you've got at least one great & low-cost event left in this town of overdone 99-cent prime rubbery ribs!   Their sandwiches inhabit the opposite spectrum of that boring and lame eatery scale -- they're big, they're seriously delicious, and there's a variety so you can always try to get a new one!  Try is implied because after having your first Bobbie or Capastrami, you may not want to edge out into the equally good Italian or heart-obliterating Cheesesteak.   But you should -- if only to prove to yourself you are good at making decisions!

REVIEW #18:  3 stars  (714 chars)
Cappriotti's would get five stars from me because they are super delicious however the problems with Carpiottis is that they are so friggin' slow I''m pretty sure they are like dry aging their ham for each individual order or something.  Trust though, I am not one of those reviewers who had one bad experience and suddenly wants to use yelp as my soap box to put a business on blast.  Every...time...I...order...it...takes.....f....o..r..e..v...e...r. I'm down to wait like 10 15 minutes (ala In N Out Burger) but it seems like Cappriottis takes like 1/2 an hour for a sandwich like ever time.  I would say if you really really love their food definitely call ahead, if not you will be sitting around for forever.

REVIEW #19:  3 stars  (583 chars)
Gave this place another shot. 1st time at this location. Walked in and was greeted right away. Got the grilled Italian. Was better this time. Good amount of meat. Liked it grilled. Would be better if bun was toasted too, because it got very soggy. Went there about 3 o'clock and was the only customer. There were at least a half-dozen employees there which seemed a little overstaffed for the time. Overall I'm still not impressed with Capriotti's. Idk what people are thinking when they rate this place the best for subs. More and more I'm convinced people from Las Vegas are crazy.

For this location in particular... I wasn't too fond of it.  We happened to be in the area and stopped for a quick dinner.  The employees weren't the friendliest, there are three tables to sit at, and the store seemed like it could use a good scrub (floors especially).  Bonus points for fountain drinks and free water.

REVIEW #21:  3 stars  (620 chars)
I think the staff is nicer at the other Capriotti's I've reviewed. Also this one has a long and open layout where you can smell the food going a lot more....today it was kinda smoky. Oddly, this one doesn't have a public restroom either so bring wipes if you get messy with your sammies.  ...  ... There's not much to say that most people already don't know. ...  ...  I like Thanksgiving dinner a lot and do have cravings for the Bobby and know it's pretty consistent.  ...  ... I'll probably be back to this location since it's the closest to mom and grandma in laws house, but I prefer the location by home much more.

REVIEW #22:  3 stars  (385 chars)
I was a bit skeptical of this little sandwich shop but a local friend of mine raved about it. As far as a sandwich shop goes I'd say it's good. The one thing I really enjoyed was the cole slaw on a number of the special sandwiches. It added a lot of moistness and crunch to an otherwise standard sandwich.  ...  ... Pretty good for a quick bite. I recommend the Capistrami. Very tasty!

Just OK. It used to be better.

REVIEW #24:  3 stars  (989 chars)
Stopped by for Lunch the other day.  This particular location has a handful of tables and chairs inside.  When I went, there were only a few people in the joint. ...  ... I ordered a Small (9") Italian Sub (Genoa Salami, Capacola, Prosciutini) w/Hot Peppers, Provolone, Mustard, Mayo, Pickles, Lettuce, Tomatoes, Onions.  Also had a bag of Jalapeno Chips and Bottled Water to go with the Sandwich. ...  ... The food came out a few minutes later and I dove right in.  As usual, it was a sloppy meal with stuff falling out of the Sandwich.  The ingredients were fresh and tasty.  For some reason, even though it's a Small Sandwich, it's always very filling. ...  ... Over the years Capriotti's has declined somewhat.  It use to blow me away, now that it's been franchised I think their ingredients have lost some quality....can't support that with fact, only my opinion after eating at various Capriotti's for over 17 yrs. ...  ... Will I return?  Probably, but won't crave it like I use to.

Good sandwiches but horrible service.  Staff of young boys are rude and unprofessional.

REVIEW #27:  2 stars  (461 chars)
I luv capriottis at other locations but the staff at this one is WEAK! They are slow and unorganized. The head girl who seems to be in charge most times I go doesnt keep things flowing well like the other locations around town. Take some pride in the art of sandwich making and customer service! Your customers are paying around $10 for a combo meal...You chose to work there, don't be miserable, gloomy, and lazy. I hope they step it up cuz I love the location

REVIEW #28:  2 stars  (691 chars)
Let me start by writing that I LOVE Capriotti's, but not lately. I always get a turkey sub with absolutely everything on it, messy and dripping with all of the toppings. The sandwich is usually busting with turkey, not deli turkey, but real turkey. However, the last few times I've gotten it the amount of turkey was minimal - barely there. Very disappointing given that I appreciated the good value the sandwiches have always been. Unfortunately, with the new owners I think they have instituted a new policy about the amount of meat you get. So, it's no longer delectable or a good value. How sad. I may have to drive to another location to see if it's a corporate-wide policy. I hope not.

REVIEW #29:  2 stars  (910 chars)
OK so I love a bobbie, i'll repeat I love a bobbie and I am a sucker for turkey day leftovers.  That being said I would give this place 1 star if it wasn't for that one sandwich.  Their bread is dry, the prices are kind of expensive and the service in any of the caps I have ever been to isn't anything spectacular (I have been to this one the most).  I guess the cap pastrami is OK too but their cold subs are tasteless, just horrible, and this is usually my favorite type of sandwich especially on a hot summer day. I recently got a small turkey sandwich with all the fixings and I ate half of it and I just gave up on it, it might have been the worst turkey sandwich I have ever had in my like and I am not fooling. The bread is the most important part of a sandwich and that is the number one thing caps is lacking, also their toppings on cold subs are plain so the whole thing comes over as boring filler.

REVIEW #30:  1 stars  (686 chars)
Crappy customer service! They were out of stuffing but didn't say anything. After 10 mins waiting I asked what we were waiting for and they said the stuffing would be just 5 more mins. Waited a total of 25 mins and they had forgotten my order. Other people got their bobbies that they ordered after me before I did. I asked for the manager and he had been standing there the whole time and didn't even offer an apology until I said something to him. I don't care how far I have to go out of my way I won't be going back to this location. This is a privately owned franchise location and I hope the manager cares enough to train his employees better and not lose money out of his pocket.

REVIEW #31:  1 stars  (596 chars)
I have been to this shop twice.  ... The first order was a philly cheese steak, no onions, no peppers. Got peppers and onions. Strike one. ... Yesterday Ordered two sandwiches, a 20" ham and turkey, got a 9' ham and roast beef. Strike two. ... second sandwich was an italian no peppers. Got peppers. Strike three. ... Should be able to expect a simple sandwich order to be correct. It's a sandwich shop, not a restaurant with 75 choices of entrees and salads, etc. ... Go to Port of Subs just over the bridge at cheyenne and rainbow. Faster service and the sandwich is correct. Damn construction.

REVIEW #32:  1 stars  (532 chars)
I really don't care much for this sandwich shop I think Jimmy Johns's is better, anyhow my fiance loves the bobbie and I get suckered into it every so often. The wait is so long that you could almost buy a turkey cook it yourself and make a sandwich no kidding. We ordered a large bobbie and it took 25 minutes to get. Their excuse was they ran out of stuffing! NO communication and when my fiance complained to the manager they didn't care. I despise all the Capriotti's if they went bankrupt no loss. Jimmy Johns's is way better!!

REVIEW #33:  1 stars  (440 chars)
The one by South Point was that I first I found & assume each is just as good since its cookie cutter.  LOVED the food. ...  ... Didn't get to order here because they wouldn't let me use the restroom first.   ...  ... People are eating everywhere inside on tables and chairs and outside on the table and chairs so its obviously not a take out only establishment.   ...  ... POOR POLICY.  Its not like its a store where I can steal in there?

This place is amazing. The staff is amazing and the food. We have been to another Capriottis around town and had some rude service once but this one is great.  ... We usually get the Bobbi. It's turkey, with stuffing, mayo and cranberry sauce. Pretty much just perfect.  ... So if you haven't tried it please do!

Writing a review because one of the vegetarian reviewers gave them a one star. ...  ... this place is good. if you are a vegetarian or vegan or whatever, please dont go here and spare us meat eaters the grief. ...  ... Capriottis is the bomb.

REVIEW #3:  4 stars  (384 chars)
Always a great sandwich here. from the Capristrami to the Bobbie you can never go wrong with a sub from Cariottis. Soft bread and full of fillings there consistency among their chain is very admirable as far as chair restaurants go. I'm lucky to have one right across the street from where I live. Youll pay a bit more than a sandwich from Subways but it's worth it extra buck or two.

REVIEW #4:  3 stars  (312 chars)
This is gonna be short and sweet. Good food but I hate when you advertise something you don't have. I can understand if something is online not on your site but you actually don't offer it. You can't fix everything. But on your own windows? If you don't offer delivery please don't have it all over your windows.

REVIEW #5:  1 stars  (292 chars)
The intelligent folks at this establishment put turkey meat on a vegetarian Bobbie sandwich because they don't understand the meaning of the word "vegetarian". They'll also refuse to make you a new sandwich and won't refund the sandwich that they made improperly. Now THAT'S customer service.

REVIEW #6:  1 stars  (273 chars)
Took about 20 minutes to make my sandwich with only 3 people ahead of me. Also there's no reason for them to wear gloves as they'll type in the register and take your order holding a pen with gloves on then turn around n make a sandwich. Not going to this location anymore.

100 % The best around

REVIEW #2:  5 stars  (950 chars)
A must stop when I am in Las Vegas!  ...  ... The sandwiches are under $6 for a small, but a small is huge! Lasts me for lunch and dinner, so I consider that a bargain.  ...  ... Even though the Capastrami seems to get the most love here- and I have tried it a loved it- I prefer the Slaw Be Joe sandwich by far. Capriotti's roast beef gets missed in reviews and it is a painful under sight. It rules! It is not like roast beef cold cuts, but like actual shredded roast! SO GOOD! I get the sandwich with cole slaw and russian dressing, sub swiss for provolone and omit the mayo- the sandwich has enough with the cole slaw IMO.  ...  ... Their cheesesteaks are also bomb. I wish I liked turkey because the Bobby sandwich looks wonderful.  ...  ... I also like that they have Wise brand chips and Tastykakes- both from Philly (home of the best sandwiches in the world!)  ...  ... My last request and plea- PLEASE bring Capriotti's to Orange County, CA!

REVIEW #3:  5 stars  (409 chars)
Across the street from South Point Hotel & Casino, this sandwich shop is as good as it gets!  I happened to be staying in South Las Vegas and had the pleasure of treating my British friends to these incredibly delicious and superfresh homemade sandwiches.   The Slaw-Be-Jo was TDF!!  They are huge and well-priced.  No matter where you are in Vegas, this sandwich shop is worth the drive.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!

REVIEW #4:  5 stars  (252 chars)
After living in vegas for two years from Boston I can finally say I found a sandwich shop that can deliver an east coast classic steak and cheese sub! Great steak and warm soft sub roll combine to bring utopia to your taste buds. Two thumbs up from me.

REVIEW #5:  5 stars  (463 chars)
Are you kidding me? Seriously, this is the best sandwich shop ever. Whenever I'm in Vegas this is must. Not only are the portions GYNORMOUS, but the price is cheap. I usually walk off the strip to this location and it is shady, so I would not recommend doing that at night. It is so good, that whenever I am in Vegas, I try to get a room with a fridge so that I can stock up. Please bring this shop to Chicago. If I were to ever own a franchise, this would be it.

REVIEW #8:  5 stars  (474 chars)
Best sandwich in vegas no questions asked. Everyone i know is obsessed with the capistrami i say its just ok nothing special there.. BUT the BOBBIE is INSANE!!!! Most carb loaded sandwich that is horrible for you and sooooo tasty. They dont normally but veggies on it but I order it with the works man i crave this sandwich all the time. Italian is good not the best Cole Turkey is awesome for sure! Never had the burgers too hard to move away from Bobbie!!!!! Get here asap

REVIEW #9:  5 stars  (233 chars)
Best sandwich is the sausage and peppers with Marinara and some of their hot peppers. Get the 20 inch and heat up the other half the following day. It's even better left over. Not all locations are perfect, but this one is fantastic.

REVIEW #10:  5 stars  (72 chars)

REVIEW #11:  5 stars  (262 chars)
Better than Earl Sandwich!! Don't believe me, try it and find out! Everytime I'm in Vegas, it's our first stop in getting a bite to eat before the maddness begins. ...  ... Eat half there and save the other half for later. You can thank me later! ...  ... Enjoy!

REVIEW #12:  5 stars  (371 chars)
Capastrami is the Best!!!! The Bobbie is good to but I have to say the Capastrami stole my heart. Whether it be on the to or leaving Vegas I always have to stop by and grab a sandwich. If your going to Vegas, this place is a MUST.  ...  ... FYI- I just came back from Vegas last weekend and they put tables and chairs inside. No more walking to Del Taco to eat. Yay!!!!!!

REVIEW #13:  5 stars  (257 chars)
Capriotti's is one of my favorite sandwich shops in Vegas.  Reminds me of the hoagie spot back east.  The sandwiches are huge filled with meat and toppings  I love the cheesesteaks and the italian!  This place is a definite must if you like a good sandwich!

REVIEW #14:  5 stars  (154 chars)
definitely the best sandwiches in vegas and they offer vegetarian options (not just a bunch of lettuce on a bun, but real veg food) a definite must try :)

REVIEW #15:  5 stars  (774 chars)
Earned every star with their awesome sandwich. Totally surprised my wife and I on the quality. ...  ... On the way back from Vegas we just wanted something light and fast. My friend (thanks Ken) recommended this place, so we thought it'd be good to just have a sandwich for a change. We didn't know it was just a take-out place so we ended up taking it to go and plan to eat it in the car. While I was filling up the gas, my wife started to open the sandwich wrapper. I knew it was really really good because she didn't make any noise. SHe was too busy enjoying the Capastrami to think about sharing. So i had a bite and it was truly the best Pastrami. I got the Cheese Steak and it was amazing too. ...  ... We both agreed that this is a must come next time we're in Vegas.

REVIEW #16:  5 stars  (229 chars)
Everything on their menu is delicious! I always get the Bobbi! I warm it up in the microwave and it tastes 100 times better. This Capriottis has the best customer service. They are more friendly here than other ones I've been to.

REVIEW #17:  5 stars  (158 chars)
Excellent sandwiches...the robbie and the cole turkey were fantastic!!! Service was quick, seating is really limited but as deli's go this is one of the best!

REVIEW #18:  5 stars  (891 chars)
First of all, the great service at this location cannot be replaced. I lived down the street from this Capriotti's but I moved further away this last month and yet I still go to this location! The guys are hilarious and accommodating. It's just always a pleasant experience at this particular location. ...  ... Secondly, the food is just as great if not better than the service. If you love sandwiches, you'll love Capriotti's. I've taken so many of my friends for their first Capriotti's experience here, and literally not one of them have ever been disappointed. ...  ... If you're vegetarian, try the veggie turkey. It's amazing!!! I cannot stop raving about that sandwich. I ate it everyday for two months haha. If you're not vegetarian, try the Bobbie! It's basically a Thanksgiving dinner on a sandwich. ...  ... Long story, short, come to this Capriotti's! You won't be disappointed.

REVIEW #20:  5 stars  (447 chars)
Great to see that everyone here loves Capriotti's as well!  I've been coming here for nearly 3 years now and I'm satisfied every single time.  I usually grab their signature subs.  The bobbie and the capastrami are my two favorites.  Great staff and great prices.  Even if you're not a sub-type guy or gal, they have plenty of sandwiches to choose from -- freshly made every time.  If you live in vegas and havent tried capriotti's.. SHAME ON YOU!

How the HECK? I honestly thought that I wrote about this place months back (July 8th). Anyway, CAPRIOTTI'S is the BEST sandwich shop in the universe. I'm being dramatic and yes...I'm exaggerating, but that is TRUE! I love their SUB SANDWICHES! Especially the Bobbi! OH, BOBBI! ::drools like Homer Simpson::  ...  ... I also ordered the other subs, but the BOBBI is the one that stands out above the rest. I love the sauce, I love the cabbage, I love the meat, I love it ALL! I was so sad when I had to leave VEGAS and travel back home to LA, but guess what.....a week after my BREAK-UP from the LV Capriotti's, I found one "GRAND OPENING" of a Capriotti's in MY AREA! Commence song!: "REunnnnnnnnited and it feeelsssss so GOOD!" ...  ... Immediately, I drove in and bought BOBBI back into my life. I was so happy that I HAD to share this with the FAMILY. I bought it for friends, and they FELL IN LOVE with it, and now....my Family-Family will experience the same!  ...  ... FYI, the one closest to me is in Azusa-Covina area, next to the Chuck-E-Cheese towards Azusa Pacific University!

REVIEW #28:  5 stars  (359 chars)
I just had the Bobbie, billed as the best sandwich in America. The medium version was everything i expected, stuffed full of homemade turkey, stuffing, cranberry sauce, and mayo. The service was super fast and the girl working at the counter was super cute. All in all, Capriotti's was awesome and i'll definitely go back later this week before I leave Vegas.

REVIEW #29:  5 stars  (284 chars)
I look forward to eating here every time I come to Las Vegas. I got the 20" cheesesteak, a 12" bobbie for the wife and a grilled cheese for the boy. I receive friendly service and would recommend this place to out-of-towners like me who get tired of eating at their hotel restaurants.

REVIEW #30:  5 stars  (275 chars)
I love this place.  And that comes even after mistakes were made.  I was already loyal but once my order was not done right.  I brought it back and it was replaced but they refunded my money and gave me vouchers.  ... I was clear that it was not a big deal but they insisted.

REVIEW #31:  5 stars  (148 chars)

REVIEW #32:  5 stars  (352 chars)
I was ecstatic to see they opened a shop next to our Vegas home!  The Bobbie is a better version of the leftover Thanksgiving dinner sandwich my grandfather used to make.  It is the perfect balance of moist turkey, savory stuffing and perfect cranberry sauce on the freshest bread.  I always get a medium so I can have half for lunch the following day!

REVIEW #33:  5 stars  (338 chars)
I'm a big fan of delicious but healthy sandwiches and Capriotti's fits the bill. We ordered the famous Bobbie sandwich and, boy, it isn't just huge but the whole sandwich is more than enough for three people! This sub is made of homemade bread, homemade turkey, cranberry sauce, delish stuffing, and Mayo! The sandwich is totally amazing!

REVIEW #34:  5 stars  (549 chars)
If you can't wait for Thanksgiving like me, Capriotti's Bobbie sandwich will more than appease your cravings!  The Bobbie consists of shredded white turkey, stuffing, cranberry sauce, mayonaise and I heard it's even better with jalapenos.  Another plus for this place is their cheap pricing.  For $7 you can get a 9-inch sub, which is definitely worth your money because it's huge and packed with meat and stuffing.  Every time I've got a sandwich here, there are usually leftovers for later.  This place is definitely my FAVORITE deli in Las Vegas.

REVIEW #35:  5 stars  (662 chars)
If you come to Vegas you MUST COME HERE. Lemme tell you rite now, this place is SUBWAY ON CRACK. ...  ... You can't go wrong with Italian or Turkey, since they're pretty standard for subs. I don't know why, but they taste so much better than subway. One thing I do know is that unlike subway or quiznos, they give you lots of meat instead of packing it with tons of lettuce! I've tried the Bobbie, and it's like a Thanksgiving meal packed into a sandwich. It's a hate it- or - love it kinda deal. It wasn't bad, but I'll stick with the Italian. ...  ... Also, for $13 you get TWENTY INCHES. Yea, 20 inches. ...  ... I ain't never goin back to subways after this.

REVIEW #36:  5 stars  (1164 chars)
It was one of those tired nights where we supposedly wanted something "small" since we just had a pretty big meal. My brother suggested Capriotti's. I was stoked as I wanted to try that place the last time we visited. ...  ... Browsed the menu and I chose the Slaw BeJo which has roast beef, provolone cheese, russian dressing, and cole slaw. It looked unbelievable in the pictures on their menu. My sister-in-law suggested me end my hubs share a large so I chose that (mind you I had no idea it would almost be the same length of a school bus). My family also ordered the Capastrami and Cole Turkey and a chopped italian salad. ...  ... We went to pick up our order and the bag with the sandwiches in it weighed as much as a toddler. The sandwiches were huge! It could probably feed me for a whole week. I could only eat a quarter of the large and it took a few days to finish since we ordered so much. I must say the sandwich was amazing. I wish we had a Capriotti's in Hawaii. They were voted best sandwiches in Best of Las Vegas so it must be good. Delicious. ...  ... Now I need to do a Capriotti's run and an In-N-Out run since we don't have those in Hawaii.

O M G!  Capastrami is the best sub I've ever had in my life!  So soft and mushy all at once!!  Yum-mmmmyyy!! ...  ... We also ordered the Homemade Turkey Sandwich (brown bread).  That was delicious, too.   ...  ... For sandwiches, you can order brown bread.  Unfortunately, they don't have brown bread for their subs. ...  ... Take out is probably the best.  Washed our sandwiches and subs down with Sweet Ice Tea.   ...  ... If you ever stayed down in the south end of the strip by Southpointe, they would deliver as well.

REVIEW #49:  5 stars  (655 chars)
This place is AMAZING..... Not only do you get a Huge Sandwich, but you get punched in the face with flavor. I have tried a few of the sandwiches that they list and they have all been delicious, The hot pastrami comes with pastrami, " Alot of it I may add" and Cole slaw. I do not like slaw but it was great in the sandwich.  This is no run of the mill sandwich farm, you get more than just a few deli slices and a half a head of lettuce.  ...  ... Dont make the mistake of thinking you are at your ordinary sandwich shop and ordering a large.. It is 20 inches long and probably 6 inches around if not more.  This is worth the trip if you are in the area.

REVIEW #50:  5 stars  (1445 chars)
This place is definitely a must-try if you're in Vegas.  I usually stop by before I start heading back home.  It's sort of weird because when I put the address into my GPS, it led me to the wrong place, but I eventually found it.  The store is small and the workers are really nice.  A downside is that they don't have seating here.  When I went, my friends and I just walked across the lot to the Del Taco and sat there and ate our sandwiches. ...  ... Everything is made to order.  Most of their sandwiches come in three sizes - small 9", medium 12", or a large 20".  They offer a bunch of different sandwiches in different categories, such as Cap's specials, cold subs, hot stuff, and vegetarian.  I love their cheese steak sandwich.  I order mushrooms with it too and it tastes amazing.  I get the medium size and usually I can only finish half of it because I can't finish the rest, which is alright because I have something to eat if I get hungry on the ride back.  The medium sized cheese steak is $8.25, but if you add mushrooms, it's another $0.50.  So the total is a little under $10.  I've only tried the cheese steak one, but my friends love the Bobbie sandwich, which is actually their best-seller.  My friends actually buy a couple of Bobbie sandwiches so they can put in the fridge when they get home and have something to eat later on in the week. ...  ... This place is definitely worth trying.  It's cheap and the food's great.

Walked in and asked what the favorite sandwich is. She said italian, and I said sounds great. 12" sub on really great bread, tasty meats all the fixings, I don't think I could eat the whole sandwich it was filling. I are half and it was perfect. Very friendly staff, like walking into Cheers where everybody knows your name.

REVIEW #52:  5 stars  (281 chars)
We had a vendor treat us to Capriottis.  OMG the Thanksgiving in a sandwich kept me full  the whole day through, certainly a meal I could only have once a year, but it's worth it. Since they brought it to us  I can't review service, or the location, I can surmise from other posts.

We were looking for a place to eat around the area and we had to try a place that has a 4+ star rating. As soon as you look at the place, all you see are awards ranging from 2006 - 2012. Capriotti's Sandwich Shop was voted best sandwich shop in Las Vegas for 6 years. It lives up to the hype and the awards.  ...  ... We tried the Chicken Cheesesteak and the Capastrami. Two amazingly delicious sandwiches. Its hard to put words on paper about the fireworks that was going off in my mouth and satisfaction my tummy felt bite after bite. Next time we are in Las Vegas, We will surly be back and try the Bobbi that everyone else on yelp talks about.  ...  ... Woohoo!!! I can't get enough of Capriotti's Sandwich Shop. Looking forward to trying the Bobbi.

What a hidden gem!  This is a small (about 5-6 tables), strip mall sandwich shop on the south end of town that grills up some delicious subs and sandwiches right before your eyes.  My family of four enjoyed several of the homemade roast turkey sandwiches (my wife said her hot turkey club had incredible flavor).  I tried their Reuben sandwich - it ranks up there with the best I've had, and will definitely order it again.  During our 5-day stay in Vegas, we stopped by twice for lunch.  These guys work hard for your business!  The service and value are outstanding, and they seem to do an enormous amount of carryout, as witnessed by (literally) grocery sacks of subs going out the door with customers during the lunch hour.  To go with your sandwich order, they also offer a variety of bottled sodas and teas, along with family-sized bags of chips (this was nice, as we purchased one bag of chips to share with everyone), and a couple of (what appeared to be) home baked desserts.

Where do I start. The Bobby sandwich is excellent.  There service is great always friendly and the wait time is 10-15 minutes top. I was so happy to find out that's there's another location in Green Valley Casino which is very close to our house.

REVIEW #56:  5 stars  (717 chars)
Where to begin where this delicious sandwich shop!!! I had thirteen guest in my party and we all enjoyed our meals very much. I ordered a medium meatball with provolone cheese and pickles...it was so tasty I bought a second one. My husband ordered the Philly cheese steak and he really enjoyed it. They also ordered the capastrami and we really enjoyed it as well...another sandwich was the turkey....least favorite.  On top of the food being delicious, the staff is amazingly friendly! ...  ... There was nothing bad to say about this place with the exception of the very limited sitting space. There are four tables with three seats each TOTAL. ...  ... IF YOUR IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD YOU SHOULD DEFINITELY STOP BY!!!!

REVIEW #57:  5 stars  (180 chars)
Yum yum yum! I don't really crave things... but I got to say... Capastrami sub is soooo good & sooo big!!! I really like the Cranslam Club on wheat!  ... This location is the BEST!

REVIEW #58:  5 stars  (330 chars)
Yum! Our to go sandwich shop every time we first get into Vegas. The sandwiches are so humongous and delicious.  If you think Earls is good, this place is way better!  The employee there are super nice and will give you what you need.  I love this place every time I come to Vegas! Makes for great leftover for midnight snacking:)

REVIEW #59:  4 stars  (75 chars)
A great selection and great services. Not the best I've had, but very good.

REVIEW #60:  4 stars  (515 chars)
Amazing sandwiches which taste even better than the 8 million pictures on Yelp. I got the bobbie and the capastrami.  ...  ... I love sandwiches, everyone loves sandwiches. These sandwiches are huge and full of flavor. I'm going to offend some people and say these sandwiches are the best in Las Vegas... yes, even better than Earl of Sandwiches. You get way more for your money. I'll be trying the rest of their sandwiches next time i'm in town.  ...  ... This is a another must try spot if you are visiting Vegas.

REVIEW #61:  4 stars  (385 chars)
CAPASTRAMI!!! You have to try this sandwich. I always get the largest one so I can eat it for three meals. The Russian dressing with slaw is so good. I also like the BOBBIE. This is a Thanksgiving dinner in hoagie form. It will definitely satisfy any hunger. The people are always so nice here and they make every sandwich fresh as you order it. Capriottis is my kind of sandwich shop.

REVIEW #62:  4 stars  (395 chars)
Cute little sandwich shop , the people were friendly and helpful , the atmosphere was happy and welcoming , I ordered the cheese steak 9" sub with Gilled onions . The bread was a little soft  for my liking but the steak was cooked perfect and there were plenty of steak , cheese and onions , the prices are very reasonable :) overall very satisfied and would return for another great sandwich :)

REVIEW #63:  4 stars  (342 chars)
First off the food here is good for the price. With large heaps of meat and toppings. In addition the subs here go from large to larger to largest which is a great bang for your buck. Service is good.  ...  ... Why only 4 stars? The food here isn't the best, unique to some degree but it isn't something that cannot be repeated anywhere else.

REVIEW #64:  4 stars  (158 chars)
Gigantic sandwiches. 9" is a small here.  Good cheesesteak. Friendly service. Highway patrol eats here. Very reasonably priced for the portions they give you.

REVIEW #65:  4 stars  (503 chars)
Good sandwiches fast!  In and out in 3 min 35 sec. ... When I'm in a hurry or late for work I always stop at capriotti's ... As I walk in I'm greeted by the person making the sandwiches. ...  " hello, order when you're ready"  ... I'll have an medium Italian. ... "would you like everything in it?" ... Yes please! Easy on the onions. Im on my way to work. ... " name please?" ...  ... They called my name,  paid the cashier, placed tip in jar. ... Cashier- " beer money! "           Crew- " thank you!"

REVIEW #66:  4 stars  (154 chars)
Got sick of Subway on this road trip, so this is a refreshing variety. Friendly staff is always a plus. Too bad we didn't have time to try their hot subs.

REVIEW #67:  4 stars  (790 chars)
Had their capastrami and a turkey sandwich, forgot what that was called buy oh my, it was yums! I've heard so many good things about Capriotti's and never had tried it myself, what a big mistake that was! And for me, I'm not much of a sandwich person, but I sure loved eating this. I had to save half of each for home. Downside is that there isn't a seating area but I don't mind eating in the car. It smelled so good, we couldn't wait, so a couple of napkins and we were set. My boyfriend and I are such big fans. Cole slaw and Russian dressing? Genius idea! I want to order that just as a side because I can't get enough of it. And they don't skimp out on the portions, every sandwich came stuffed, I could not fit my mouth around it. Definitely get your money's worth. Move over, Subway!

REVIEW #68:  4 stars  (375 chars)
Hawaii doesn't have and REALLY NEEDS a sandwich shop like this one. ...  ... The Must-SAMPS sammiches: ... 1. The "Capastrami" is to d-i-e. I love pastrami and this only indulges my love for it even more. ... 2. The "Bobbie" is sweet and salty in one. I'm not a fan of turkey, cranberry, or stuffing during Thanksgiving but, I could mos def eat this all Thanksgiving night!!!

REVIEW #69:  4 stars  (294 chars)
I feel like I'm cheating on The Bobbie - my former favorite sandwich that is pretty much Thanksgiving in a sandwich... BUT I must give a shout-out to my other two loves... the CheeseSteak AND the Capastrami w/ everything on them.  Totally hits the spot when you're craving a "gourmet" sandwich.

REVIEW #70:  4 stars  (738 chars)
I had just arrived in Las Vegas with my teenage daughter and her gymnastics teammate.  All were hungry, so we used Yelp to find the nearest, highest-rated, cheap place to eat.  We ended up at Capriotti's, and I can't wait to eat here again.  On the recommendation of the guy behind the counter, I had The Bobbie, which is turkey with stuffing and cranberry.  I always say the foundation of a good sandwich is great bread, and The Bobbie I had was a great sandwich.  My daughter and her friend had (what I consider boring) turkey sandwiches on wheat bread.  My daughter's sandwich, in particular, wasn't great, but she always orders her sandwiches dry.  Her friend's sandwich had mayo and mustard on it, and she seemed to really like hers.

REVIEW #71:  4 stars  (710 chars)
I have only tried one sandwich here and it's so good I have never wanted or even was curious to try out something else. So my rating is only for this particular sandwich : Chicken Philly with no cheese,grilled onions, mushrooms,sweet & hot red/green peppers and a little mayo...Oh Baby, give it to me....  ... This Capriotti's is uniformly made just like other Capriotti's-service was quick and sufficient. I am sad to see that this Capriotti's doesn't sell Mini "Nothing Bundtcakes" here but instead they serve Tasty Kakes products. People from the East Coast seem to go crazy for Tasty Kakes-I bought the Jelly filled cakes and it was OK, nothing special-I'd rather buy a Twinkie. Anyhow, my sandwich-YUM!!!!

REVIEW #72:  4 stars  (792 chars)
I ordered a Capastrami and a Bobbie. The Capastrami I ate within a few minutes of leaving (it's takeout only, so we ate at South Point). The sandwich was incredible. I have 2 restaurants near me that serve giant pastrami sandwiches with cole slaw, and the one from Capriotti's was definitely competitive. The medium was a great size. ...  ... When I got home to Los Angeles, my girlfriend and I split the Bobbie. It was definitely tasty, but I prefer cream cheese to mayonnaise on my thanksgiving-style sandwiches. The sandwich was a little dry, and only had slightly above average flavor. ...  ... All in all, I would definitely recommend this place to friends, and I will try to visit the Beverly Hills location. I just can't give 5 stars because of the dining situation and the dry Bobbie.

REVIEW #73:  4 stars  (231 chars)
I really love their sandwiches.  The meat they use is fresh, definitely not deli style on their specialty sandwiches.  It is one of my favorite places to get a sandwich that is worth anything...nothing else compares to the quality.

REVIEW #74:  4 stars  (749 chars)
I visit Las Vegas for work a few days out of every month. A few months ago a coworker treated me to one of Capriotti's Sandwich Shop's subs and I liked it, I liked it a lot.  ...  ... The restaurant is a Quiznos Sub Shop or Subway Restaurant type but better. A wide variety or sandwiches and subs, but my personal favorites in the hot steak and cheese with mushrooms, peppers and onions. The clouds part because it's heavenly. I have a few others on my to do list too.  ...  ... 4 stars! Why? It's what I want in a quick and easy sandwich shop. Order in or take out and phenomenal food.  It's a must if and when I visit Las Vegas.  Why not 5 stars?  Not exactly an invited dine in experience but...  Don't think you're not my favorite Cap.  You are!

REVIEW #75:  4 stars  (269 chars)
I've never been a huge fan of Capriotti's but apparently I'm the only one  ...  ... I can't knock the customer service or cleanliness of this location because both are great ...  ... Maybe it's just one of those things that I have to have multiple times to finally love

REVIEW #76:  4 stars  (654 chars)
Nine inches is small? That's the sort of thing that makes me feel inadequate.  ...  ... I mean, must make other sandwich shops feel inadequate. How are any of these other joints supposed to compete when $7 will get you nine fantastic inches of OFFICIAL cheesesteak. $13 will get you 20 inches. That's a lot of sandwich. ...  ... And the Capastrami ain't bad either. I have to admit that I've had better pastrami, but I lived three blocks from Katz's for years, so I'm spoiled. However, I do love the flavor combination. ...  ... The bread, the steak, the smiles, and the value here all justify the enormous wall of awards Capriotti's absolutely deserves.

REVIEW #77:  4 stars  (214 chars)
Primo sandwhiches - I usually go for the philly steak or the Bobbie. Love this location too. Always great service.  ...  ... If I could change anything I wish they would bring back their entertainment book coupons.

REVIEW #78:  4 stars  (181 chars)
Quality sandwiches. I've tried enough of the menu to know that you won't be disappointed with regard to taste, portion, or service. This is the best sandwich chain I've come across.

REVIEW #79:  4 stars  (797 chars)
Thank you YELP! We were in Las Vegas for a day trip (freakin' Time Share presentations) and didn't know where to go for a quick lunch. We looked up the local restaurants on our trusty iPhone app and quickly found this sandwich joint close by. ...  ... I'm not big on sandwiches at all. I mean, come on! I can make a sandwich at home, why eat out for a sandwich. Well, Capriotti's will make me reconsider the art of the sandwich deli. "The Bobbie" sandwich was highly recommended. Wow, fresh roasted chicken shredded for a lovely sub with stuffing, cranberry sauce . It's thanksgiving dinner in a sandwich! Delicious. I definitely think it's the fresh turkey that makes this sandwich so good. It was huge and genorously stuffed (that's what she said!, Sorry, too good to pass up). Thanks Capriotti!

REVIEW #80:  4 stars  (752 chars)
The only thing I ever order is the Bobbie. With a sandwich this good, there is no need to get anything else. The idea of Thanksgiving in a sandwich is brilliant and the person to come up with it should be given an award. Turkey, stuffing, cranberry sauce and mayo is the normal combination. I prefer mine with light to little mayo, because the meat is not dry and the cranberry sauce makes sure that the sandwich is not like the Las Vegas landscape.  ...  ... This is a staple for when my friends and I decided to go kayaking down the Colorado River. One small sub was enough to power me through the five to six hour ordeal. Nothing goes along with a day down the river more than a Bobbie in my backpack and some beer dangling behind in the cold river.

REVIEW #81:  4 stars  (395 chars)
They make some good of the best sandwiches I have had.  ...  ... I would stay away from the homemade turkey sandwich on wheat as that was the only sandwich I had there I was not satisfied with. ...  ... I usually get the Capistrami with extra hot peppers or the cheesesteak with extra hot and onions.  ...  ... Always get good friendly service and I call in my order for pickup most of the time.

REVIEW #82:  4 stars  (1093 chars)
This location no longer allows you to eat at the establishment. Take out only.  ...  ... I've tried "the bobbie" in the past. It is with their homemade turkey, cranberry sauce & stuffing. Not a fave of mine, but it is definitely something different and full of yummy thanksgiving flavor anytime of the year.  ...  ... I got a small genoa salami ($6) today and it was HUGE. I couldn't even eat it all and still have half of it waiting in the fridge. All the subs come with provolone cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, onions and choice of sweet or hot peppers, mayo, oil, etc. They don't have a lot of choices in toppings, but pretty much the basics, which is just fine with me! ...  ... The bread is freshly made in house and they are not shy or stingy when it comes to piling on the meat (unlike subway!). After a couple of bites into my sandwich, the fillings were oozing out and couldn't keep up with the bread! By the last bite, I had a little piece of bread with majority of it being meat and lettuce. ...  ... Service here is good, the guys who work there are very friendly. Service is fast too.

REVIEW #83:  4 stars  (277 chars)
We stopped because of the reviews very accurate very good. The place is small not many seats. I had the turkey my wife had the roast beef both were very good. The only thing I did not like was the bread could've been better tasted like a large hot dog bun. ... We will be back!

REVIEW #84:  4 stars  (750 chars)
We stumbled upon this gem due to finding an Indian restaurant for my traditional grandparents that can't digest anything non traditional. I have developed an aversion to Indian food, due to the constant need to find different locales that offer this culinary delight to my grandparent's pleasure. So, when I saw a sandwich shop, I decided to buy a sandwich along with my mother and my aunt. Whenever I frequent Subway, I always order a foot long, due to my voracious and manly appetite. However, you get more than you bargain for and a small is the only size I could envision myself digesting! It's H-U-G-E! And mmm it was delicious :) My taste buds are singing in a symphony of joy when I envision it...I'm going to jump in the car and GO RIGHT NOW!

REVIEW #85:  4 stars  (393 chars)
When I'm hungry I never crave sandwiches. I just feel like its one of those things that I can make at home for much cheaper. BUT i have to admit, Capriotti's is pretty good. The samples sound simple and the menu is limited, but their sandwiches are SOO tasty! Plus I love their huge sizes. A sandwich can feed 3 or 4 people if you're not a big eater. Definitely a stop when you roll into town!

REVIEW #86:  3 stars  (213 chars)
A good sandwich, but I didn't think it was the 'second comming' of subs like some think.  As it is 'take out', no bathroom - not a big deal but inconvenient if traveling like we were.  Convenience store next door.

REVIEW #87:  3 stars  (214 chars)
Got "The Bobbie" to see what all the hype was about. It honestly wasn't the greatest sandwich I've ever tasted referring to the sandwiches back in San Francisco, but it was pretty good. Better than Subway for sure!

REVIEW #88:  3 stars  (1195 chars)
I had never heard of this place before but apparently, there is one in Los Angeles too. Me and my group of friends on our way to Zion National Park in Utah stopped here and I saw a pastrami sandwich so I tried it. After having Langer's Deli in Los Angeles and having their pastrami sandwich, nothing else really compares. Capriotti's Capastrami sandwich does not compare to Langer's legendary #19. The Capastrami comprises of hot pastrami in a roll with cole slaw, swis cheese, and Russian dressing. I added cucumbers and tomatoes to add extra health value to it. Ultimately, the sandwich was oversauced. I could not taste the pastrami at all and I felt a little sick afterwards. ...  ... One of my other friends ordered the "Bobbi" sandwich which consisted of turkey, stuffing, and cranberry sauce to give it the Thanksgiving theme. The sandwich was way too heavy for the quarter portion that I had. One of my other buddies told me that the Italian sandwich was good so maybe I should have gotten that. Either way, this sandwich shop is okay. Not the best I have had, but by and large not the worst. If there had been less sauce on the Capastrami, I would have given this place a higher rating.

REVIEW #89:  3 stars  (624 chars)
I love Capriotti's but I wasn't in love with the service at this location. They weren't super rude; they just seemed...uninterested, almost slightly annoyed that we were ordering. We ordered and then walked to another store and when we came back the cook told us they didn't have enough of the ingredient needed to make the sandwich we ordered. Totally cool, shit happens, but I wish they would've said something when we ordered. Also, there is no soda machine, so be prepared to pay for a can of something. It wasn't terrible, I just wasn't blown away like I've come to expect from Capriotti's. I give them 3 brusque stars.

REVIEW #90:  3 stars  (555 chars)
I went there for lunch and ordered a ham & cheese sub. There was a line of people so it took them about 20 mins to make the sub. The employees were friendly and seemed to be working hard getting all the orders out without too much delay.  ...  ... As for the sub - it was meh! The ingredients seemed fresh enough but the bread was far from the best bread I have had on a sub. Maybe people like it because it is really sweet but I would rather have bread that tastes like bread! Maybe the cooked sandwiches are better but I wouldn't order another cold one.

REVIEW #91:  3 stars  (729 chars)
I've heard about these shops and this one is in my neighborhood, right next to the comic shop I go to. I won't say it's bad, but they have a limited selection of sandwiches and they make you feel like you have to know a secret password to tell them what you wanted on it, or they assumed you knew everything that came on it, even though the menu doesn't say much. The second time I went in there I ordered a Grilled Italian sandwich, and when I said I wanted Mayonnaise, the employee responded with "on the sandwich?" Ummm... I just ordered a sandwich and asked for Mayo, do you think I want it in my soda or spread on my car in the parking lot? YES ON THE SANDWICH! ...  ... I'll stick to Subway, better service and ingredients.

REVIEW #92:  3 stars  (149 chars)
not as good as they used to be. I used to go to Capriotti's allot to get my steak and mushroom sup fix. it was good but not as good as it used to be.

REVIEW #93:  3 stars  (457 chars)
Not the best sandwich I have had, but better than fast food subs. The Bobby was a unique take, but the rest of the menu was kind of so so.  I had the chicken cheese.  The chicken was good, shredded white meat that tasted fresh and the only reason I'm rating three stars. Be advised, if you like hot pepper, the pepper option is pepper relish that wasn't spicy at all.   ...  ... This is a take out place! (no public restroom and not much of a seating area).

REVIEW #94:  3 stars  (350 chars)
Pretty good, I'm still not sure what all the hype is about. I don't go out of my way to go eat here, there's limited seating and they overcharge for their bottled drinks like snapple/pure leaf tea etc.I paid $2.99 for a pure leaf tea and saw it at Vons that same day for $1.00. ...  ... They only have white bread no wheat or healthier selections....

I don't know, I think its overrated. its nothing too special. they over load their sandwiches with mayonnaise, butter, and other oily fats. maybe it's just me since i'm a bit of a health freak. butttt my boyfriend is all about it.

REVIEW #98:  2 stars  (588 chars)
I love Capriotti's. Unfortunately, this location disappoints me. I am subjected to go to this location because it is the only one close to me. What I really dislike about this particular location is that they squish the bread so much! If anyone from this location ever reads this please stop squishing the bread while you're packing the sandwich. Every single time I come here the bread always ends up looking so thin and squished. I didn't order a flatbread sandwich. I want a nice and fluffy bread for my sandwich. I'll change my rating only if they stop squishing the bread so much. =\

REVIEW #99:  2 stars  (411 chars)
Sandwich sizes were HUGE.  The place wasn't the cleanest and had NO SEATING or apparent bathrooms.  Yes, the Bobby tastes like thanksgiving, but a mess of a half-hearted thanksgiving it was.  I'll wait until November next time, thank you.  The Italian sandwich my wife had was nice.  Bread was hardly better than Subway.  An alright place to eat if you are hungry but I won't be going out of my way to get here.

REVIEW #100:  2 stars  (363 chars)
Seriously? ... My cheesesteak had barely any meat inside. It was a pathetic combination of meat to bread. Are you that incompetent that you can't even compile a correct sandwich together. They must have been in a rush. THE QUALITY IS LACKING. ... What a shame... I thought I lucked out having it so close to my house. I'll stick to the one on paradise and harmon.

Home of the Bobbie-basically a Thanksgiving dinner on a roll so that's turkey, cranberry and stuffing, mayo if you want it.  The sandwich's are huge and filling, good to share.  ...  ... Other good ones are the Capistrami and the Eggplant parmesan!  Wonderful! Yum!

REVIEW #4:  5 stars  (408 chars)
I had the same sandwich twice, once it was the last left over piece on a party tray and it got me salivating at what a fresh sandwich might taste like. I forgot the name of the sandwich but it had I think pastrami and this kick ass pastrami on it that really counteracted the meat to perfection. Fresh is definitely better. It's a shame that the sandwiches aren't larger though, that would have been awesome.

REVIEW #5:  5 stars  (348 chars)
I used to work in a sandwich shop and this place is one of my favorites. They prepare everything after you order which is awesome, takes time but is totally worth it.  ...  ... Another plus is that they have big bags of chips, most places only have the regular bags so it's a plus. Guys working in this location are really nice. Quick and friendly.

REVIEW #6:  5 stars  (1130 chars)
I'm a Capriotti's fan. I eat at one 1-2 times a week. This is one location I love because not only is it tasty but it is near a Home Depot I frequent.  ...  ... The store is clean. The dining area isn't very big so I usually phone my order in and pick it up to go. During lunch hours this location is a mad house and can get cramped but obviously worth it! ...  ... I like that Capriotti's has been giving a $3 coupon on some receipts I get. Not sure how long it will last but as long as it is around I will be appreciative! Pay attention to your receipt you might have one on there. You do have to go to a website and fill out a brief survey but it is quick and worth the discount. ...  ... I'm a sucker for a "Capastrami". It has Pastrami, Swiss, Cole Slaw, and Russian Dressing on a hoagie roll. It is pure heaven with each bite. ...  ... They have a variety of sandwiches to choose from. ...  ... Should you be a fan of the "tastykake" brand they carry a variety of their snacks. The "Wise" brand chips are my fav. ...  ... Sandwich sizes are as follows: ... -Small is 9 inches ... -Medium is 12 inches ... -Large is 20 inches

REVIEW #8:  5 stars  (2486 chars)
My husband and I love Capriotti's, and have been regular customers of the Craig Road/Home Depot shop for a decade. We can honestly say that we have never had a bad meal. The consistency of high quality subs and the great variety make this a place we can't resist, no matter what our bathroom scales may say! We've never had guests that we haven't treated to Capriotti's, and we've never had a rude encounter with any of the staff.  ...  ... Some marvelous subs to try - great with a group, where everyone shares:  ...  ... Capistram--melt-in-your mouth pastrami with no gristle or excess fat. Both the swiss and provolone cheeses add another layer of flavor to the pastrami. The Russian dressing pulls it all together. The Cole Slaw adds texture and juice. Bibs might be advised, since this sub can be drippy-licious.  ...  ... The Bobbie -- Thanksgiving on a sub, just the way we like it: Turkey, cranberry sauce, stuffing and mayo. When we have Thanksgiving at someone's home, and we don't get leftovers, we like to stop at Caparotti's the next day so we can pretend we're enjoying all those yumdiddy-great leftovers.  ...  ... Cole Turkey -- a "Bobbie" without the cranberry sauce or stuffing. For those who want to assuage their after-Thanksgiving guilt by avoiding sweet cranberry sauce and an extra bread product. I still like it loaded full-tilt-boogie with the entire table of treats! ...  ... Slaw Be Jo - thinly sliced roast beef, tender and moist, lathered with Russian dressing, mayo and their sweet-savory cole slaw, topped with provolone cheese. It's a toss up when you're in a beef mood whether the Slaw Be Jo or the Cheese Steak is the tastiest. We normally rely on a coin flip, since our taste buds crave both!  ...  ... I don't do red sauce so I rely on the opinion of guests from out of town who tell us they love the Sausage sub with marinara sauce, as well as the meatball sub. I'm also not an italian meat and hot pepper fan, so again, I rely on the opinions of those who love this combination.  ...  ... Yes, I hear you. What the heck am I doing living in Las Vegas if I don't love Italian or Mexican food? Fortunately, at Capriotti's, there are choices to suit everyone's taste buds.  ...  ... I've yet to taste a better cheesesteak anywhere in the valley, nor a finer hot pastrami.  ...  ... Note to service dog users: the staff is welcoming to service dogs, and you won't have any problem with access. They keep their distance, practice good service dog etique

What can be said about Caps' Bobby? Everything, it's my favorite all time sandwich! It's the best. This location has very friendly people and it's always clean and nice. We always stop by here on our way out of town and they have no problem with making my wife her special sandwich.

REVIEW #12:  5 stars  (144 chars)
WOW!  I have never ate here before and it was well worth the stop!  The food is unbelievably good, Subway and Quiznos has nothing on these guys!

Arrived 30 min before closing. Guys working were friendly & fixed sandwich quickly. Mushroom cheese steak great as usual.

As a previous person stated, this is definitley not the establishment for 5 star service but I love the sandwiches. Personal fav: the Bobby... It's like thanksgiving on a sandwich:)

REVIEW #15:  4 stars  (328 chars)
Coming from the South Bay, when I lived in Sin City I totally missed sandwiches from Togos. So imagine my excitement when some co-workers put me on to Capriotti's. The sandwiches here are amazing! My faves are the Capistrami and the Bobbie - which is totally like a little bit of Thanksgiving.. all you need is some pumpkin pie.

REVIEW #16:  4 stars  (246 chars)
Excellent sandwhiches. I usually get the Capastrami and/or The Bobbie. I'd choose this place over Subway or Quiznos any day. A little more pricey, but welll worth it my opinon. Lunch hours can get busy. Therefore call in your order ahead of time.

REVIEW #17:  4 stars  (348 chars)
For a sandwich shop with a limited selection they really bring their A game. I cant remember the name of my sandwich but it was a hot sandwich with schredded chicken and all of the extra goodies on top with a special sauce. It was quite delicious ....so if I were you and in the area of this shop I'd definately go check it out =) small but good =)

REVIEW #18:  4 stars  (135 chars)
I have to agree with all the other Yelp reviews...tried the Bobbie and love it!  I'm from Dallas and wish there was one closer to home.

REVIEW #19:  4 stars  (401 chars)
I'm from LA. Nothing will ever compare to Johnny Pastrami but this satisfies me pretty good until then. Husband gets the Capastrami, which i have to admit looked AMAZING. However I wanted a regular Hot Pastrami, not on the menu but they made it for me. :) Enough of each sauce, pickles and $20 for 2 medium (footlong) subs. We eat here about once a month for our Pastrami cravings, no complaints. YUM.

I've always been a fan of Capriotti's and still think that they have some of the best cheese steaks in Las Vegas.  This particular Cap is located in North Las Vegas in the Home Depot shopping center.  It's a small restuarant with limited tables/chairs inside and a few more outside.   ...  ... Cap sells their sandwiches in 3 sizes; 9 inch, 12 inch, and their monster 20 inch.  I have friends that recommend the Bobbi (turkey and cranberry) and their Capastrami (their pastrami swiss).  I am told both these sandwiches are really good.  However, I've yet to try either.  I've only tried two different subs here; they're steak/cheese and chicken/cheese.  Both meats are thinly sliced, seasoned, and coated in melted cheese.  I usually have both sandwiches plain so that I can savor the meats more.  You can't go wrong with either sandwich.  Simply state, both are delicious.  ...  ... Service is not bad at all and really depends on how busy they are.  Between 11:30 AM and 1 PM, this place can be a madhouse.  Cap is little more pricey compared to say  ... Subway, but the food here is much better.

If your looking for Philly sandwiches in Vegas. This is a good stop. As close as your going to get. They also have Wise potato chips and TastyKake.

REVIEW #22:  4 stars  (185 chars)
Love this place. The best and freshest sandwiches in Vegas.  If you like Real Turkey(like Thanksgiving), fresh breads and killer peppers...hit them up when in town.  You won't be sorry!

REVIEW #23:  4 stars  (1148 chars)
There's not much that I can say that hasn't already been said.  Cap's serves a mean sandwich.  No, they serve an amazing sandwich. I can have it for every meal when I'm in town.  I've only tried one variety though, because it was so fantastic, I've never felt the need to try anything else! I tried Caps' for the first time at a Yelp Elite event, and  made my friends take me there immediately for a full-size sandwich experience.  I didn't realize it was a chain until much later, as they don't have Cap's where I live, so sad.  ...  ... My one true sandwich love: The Bobbie.  Turkey, cranberries, and stuffing.  I've tried to replicate it at home, and I can't even come close They must sprinkle it with magic.  It's not the cheapest sandwich in town, but you get what you pay for.  I need to try other sandwiches to see if they're just as fab, and if so, they definitely deserve a 5-star rating.  ...  ... This location is one of my favorites - it's  fast and friendly, with plenty of room to sit and enjoy your sandwich.  They also give military discounts, and if you check in on Yelp, they usually have a check-in offer (not all locations do).

REVIEW #24:  4 stars  (206 chars)
This is my favorite sandwich place in Vegas. I recommend the Capistrami or the Bobby, they are amazing. Also a good tip is to go with a friend and split a 20" sandwich, makes it significantly cheaper there!

REVIEW #25:  4 stars  (1313 chars)
This is one of the two capriotti's I've been too. Which is a bit more convenient for me, since its just down the street from where I live. The second one, is at Aliante Station.  ...  ... Focusing on this Sandwich Shop, I have to say that this is unique in it's own sense. There are some things I do like about it, and other things that I don't like. But the most important thing is, their sandwiches are great. I'm not sure about other Capriotti's, but I know that Aliante doesn't have it, but this Capriotti's has their 20 inch sandwich. That's why I like this place I love their LARGE sandwiches. I do like their staff, which is nice and friendly. Despite the fact of them being busy, they still tend to be upbeat.  ...  ... On the other hand, even though their location is convenient. Mainly off Craig and MLK next to Pet Smart and Home Depot. It is a small sandwich shop. When it gets busy, its kind of uncomfortable standing around for a sandwich. They only have 3 small tables, and a few worn out chairs. The floor itself, seen better days.  ...  ... Overall, I would suggest this place for their sandwiches, but not so much on dining in. They do have a few tables outside, but I would just go their for pick up. Their sandwiches are great, their staff is great. That's all I need to go to Capriotti's for.

REVIEW #26:  4 stars  (202 chars)
This relatively small chain of sandwich shops serves up some very good sandwiches. ...  ... The "cran slam" is a known favorite. ...  ... Wide selection from veggie to both hot and cold- all very fresh.

REVIEW #27:  4 stars  (132 chars)
YUMMY!! This place was super good!! The price was cheap for how big the sub was. It was such a hole in the wall, but very delicious!

REVIEW #28:  3 stars  (686 chars)
I love Capriotti's sandwiches, no matter what shop I've gone to the food is pretty much the same.  This one in particular is not in a casino and is seriously lacking some fung shui.  There is no order counter here, you just walk up to the edge of the kitchen to place your order and to pick it up.  If you've never been here it would be easy just to keep walking right into the kitchen.  The dinning area is tiny but they have a few tables outside.  Last time I went in there I ordered two items, and they wrote them down.  Yet somehow they failed to get it correct.  Still enjoyed them because it's Cap's and it was still good.  I wish they would make the bobbie hot though... booh-hoo

REVIEW #29:  3 stars  (1064 chars)
This Capriotti's location is the closest one to my job, so a couple times a month when I just need a sandwich to get me through the day, I'll opt for Capriotti's. ...  ... It's your standard Capriotti's-pretty small on the inside, nothing fancy. The employees are nice and the dining area is always clean. I wouldn't suggest making plans to dine here during the lunch hours though. This location is always packed and if you don't want to wait, call your order in. I always do and my sandwich is always ready and waiting so I don't have to wait awkwardly in the dining area and watch other people get to enjoy their tasty sandwiches. ...  ... I really like their selection of chips which I don't think you can really get anywhere else and the fact that they offer Tastykakes, which I've never had, but have read enough Stephanie Plum books to appreciate the novelty. ...  ... I guess my only beef with Capriotti's is that they serve Pepsi. That's a personal preference though, so I just never get drinks here.  ...  ... Bottom line: average Capriotti's, call ahead.

This is a nice little place that has some pretty good sandwich's. I got the vegetarian turkey sandwich they also have vegetarian cheese steak (unfortunately no vegan cheese) , but its nice to have some veg options.

REVIEW #31:  3 stars  (1002 chars)
This place is small, located in the strip mall on Craig, next to the Pets Mart. After picking up some doggy items my boyfriend and I stopped here to grab some sandwiches to go on a Saturday afternoon. ...  ... I went in to order while my boyfriend kept our four-legged friend busy outside where they have some tables set up for out-door eating. Um, too bad it stinks outside right around the area of the store though. Definitely not appetizing to eat sandwiches around a sewer-like smell. ...  ... I have given Capriotti's a 5-Star Review before, but this was kind of "meh". I'm bumping it up to 3-Stars though because the Bobbie was yummy per usual. Unlike a lot of people, I'm not a regular at Capriotti's because I'm more of a Port of Subs girl for my go-to sandwich. However, Capriotti's hits the spot sometimes. ...  ... This location is tiny by the way and there's not much seating to speak of inside. Also, the set up to pay/get your sandwich/get your drinks is a little clumsy to say the least.

REVIEW #32:  3 stars  (725 chars)
This place would earn a higher rating from me if they took a little care in making the sandwiches. The ingredients are of high quality, but are used inconsistently and carelessly when the sandwich is made. It is not as if I am surprised, as they are assembled by young lads and lasses who are probably making something akin to minimum wage. Speaking of which, I find it a tad odd that these youthful people call their tips "beer money." Do they take the tips and wait outside a gas station, trying to convince patrons to buy them a twelver? Maybe they should call the tips "candy money" or whatever it is American youngins buy today. Old man rants aside, the sandwiches here are very good, and it is a great fast food option.

REVIEW #33:  3 stars  (661 chars)
This was my third time here. Came here for lunch today and had the Italian. It was ok. The second time, I had the Meatball. It wasn't that good. The first time, I had the Mushroom Cheesesteak. It was the best out of what I've tried so far. ...  ... The place is pretty small. There are four or five tables and a tv playing the ESPN channel. There are also some tables outside. The staff is always friendly. ...  ... I paid with my card on my first visit and their is a offer to get $3 off on your next visit if you do an online survey. I didn't get that offer on my second or third visit when I paid in cash. My buddy who paid with his card today got the offer.

REVIEW #34:  2 stars  (618 chars)
One star because the guys behind the counter were sweet and nice. Another because of price. ...  ... In short, my sandwich sucked and am upset because the guy recommended me to get the sandwich over my original order... it was the turkey something... which was pretty much a thanksgiving meal on wheat bread (turkey meat, cranberry, gravy). I ate the whole thing because I eat everything and because I was starving! ...  ... My cousin who is a local swears by this place. I apparently did not order the right thing. I had a taste of her sandwich (pastrami) and it was soo much better - wish I had ordered the pastrami.

REVIEW #35:  2 stars  (808 chars)
PROS:  ... I had just flown into Vegas and was in need of food before I head to the clubs to get wasted! My friends who are Las Vegas residents swear by this place but I don't understand why. The only Pro this place deserves in convenience.  ...  ... CONS:  ... I ordered my sandwich..they were barely paying attention, I had to repeat my order 3 times. How hard is it to understand Turkey on wheat with extra mustard? Extra Mayo? The guys said? NO!!!!! Extra mustard! YELLOW! YELLOW! YELLOW!!!!!! then to top off this horrible experience, the dude hands me my sandwich (foot long) without a bag while he gave my other friends their sandwiches in bags.  ...  ... HELLLLLLO!?!?!?! Can I get a bag? dumbass!  ... Got home, the sandwich sucked! Wish I would went to Subway!  ...  ... FINAL ANSWER: GO to Subway!

REVIEW #36:  2 stars  (143 chars)
There's only one good sandwich here, and it's the Bobbie. Capriotti's is overpriced and I suggest that you look elsewhere for  decent sandwich.
